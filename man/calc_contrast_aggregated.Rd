\title{Calculate between contrast analysis from aggregated data (means, sds and ns)}
\usage{
calc_contrast_aggregated(means, sds, ns, between, lambda_between, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{means}{numeric vector of mean values for every condition}

\item{sds}{numeric vector of standard deviation values for every condition}

\item{ns}{numeric vector of sample size values for every condition}

\item{between}{factor for the independent variable that divides the data into
independent groups}

\item{lambda_between}{numeric vector for contrast weights. Names must match
the levels of \code{between}. If \code{lambda_between} does not sum up to
zero, this will be done automatically (centering).}

\item{data}{optional argument for the \code{data.frame} containing all variables
except for lambda_between}
}
\value{
an object of type cofad_bw, including p-value, F-value, contrast
  weights, different effect sizes
