A representative set of drive facets was derived from an extensive corpus of human attributes (Study 1). Operationalised using an International Personality Item Pool version (the Drive:IPIP), a three-factor model was extracted from the facets in two samples and confirmed on a third sample (Study 2). The multi-item IPIP measure showed congruence with a short form, based on single-item ratings of the facets, and both demonstrated cross-informant reliability. Evidence also supported the measures' convergent, discriminant, concurrent, and incremental validity (Study 3). Based on very promising findings, the authors hope to initiate a stream of research in what is argued to be a rather neglected niche of individual differences and non-cognitive assessment.},

Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of the scientific method", and the "father of modern science".Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances", inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses, and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn and the analysis of sunspots. Galileo's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to geocentric models such as the Tychonic system. He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture". Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. While under house arrest, he wrote Two New Sciences, in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.},

The ratio of the high period to the total period of a pulse wave is called the duty cycle. A true square wave has a 50\% duty cycle (equal high and low periods). Square waves are often encountered in electronics and signal processing, particularly digital electronics and digital signal processing. Its stochastic counterpart is a two-state trajectory.},

  abstract = {The Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) is a self-report personality test developed over several decades of empirical research by Raymond B. Cattell, Maurice Tatsuoka and Herbert Eber. The 16PF provides a measure of normal personality and can also be used by psychologists, and other mental health professionals, as a clinical instrument to help diagnose psychiatric disorders, and help with prognosis and therapy planning. The 16PF can also provide information relevant to the clinical and counseling process, such as an individual's capacity for insight, self-esteem, cognitive style, internalization of standards, openness to change, capacity for empathy, level of interpersonal trust, quality of attachments, interpersonal needs, attitude toward authority, reaction toward dynamics of power, frustration tolerance, and coping style. Thus, the 16PF instrument provides clinicians with a normal-range measurement of anxiety, adjustment, emotional stability and behavioral problems. Clinicians can use 16PF results to identify effective strategies for establishing a working alliance, to develop a therapeutic plan, and to select effective therapeutic interventions or modes of treatment. It can also be used within other areas of psychology, such as career and occupational selection.Beginning in the 1940s, Cattell used several techniques including the new statistical technique of common factor analysis applied to the English-language trait lexicon to elucidate the major underlying dimensions within the normal personality sphere. This method takes as its starting point the matrix of inter-correlations between these variables in an attempt to uncover the underlying source traits of human personality. Cattell found that personality structure was hierarchical, with both primary and secondary stratum level traits. At the primary level, the 16PF measures 16 primary trait constructs, with a version of the Big Five secondary traits at the secondary level. These higher-level factors emerged from factor-analyzing the 16 x 16 intercorrelation matrix for the sixteen primary factors themselves. The 16PF yields scores on primary and second-order "global" traits, thereby allowing a multilevel description of each individual's unique personality profile.  A listing of these trait dimensions and their description can be found below. Cattell also found a third-stratum of personality organization that comprised just two overarching factors.The measurement of normal personality trait constructs is an integral part of Cattell's comprehensive theory of intrapersonal psychological variables covering individual differences in cognitive abilities, normal personality traits, abnormal (psychopathological) personality traits, dynamic motivational traits, mood states, and transitory emotional states which are all taken into account in his behavioral specification/prediction equation.

As for the mood state domain, Cattell and his colleagues constructed the Eight State Questionnaire (8SQ), a self-report (Q-data) measure of eight clinically important emotional/mood states, labeled Anxiety, Stress, Depression, Regression, Fatigue, Guilt, Extraversion, and Arousal.},

  abstract = {In engineering and science, dimensional analysis is the analysis of the relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities (such as length, mass, time, and electric current) and units of measure (such as miles vs. kilometres, or pounds vs. kilograms) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed. The conversion of units from one dimensional unit to another is often easier within the metric or SI system than in others, due to the regular 10-base in all units. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the factor-label method, also known as the unit-factor method, is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of algebra.Commensurable physical quantities are of the same kind and have the same dimension, and can be directly compared to each other, even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure, e.g. yards and metres, pounds (mass) and kilograms, seconds and years. Incommensurable physical quantities are of different kinds and have different dimensions, and can not be directly compared to each other, no matter what units they are originally expressed in, e.g. meters and kilograms, seconds and kilograms, meters and seconds. For example, asking whether a kilogram is larger than an hour is meaningless. Any physically meaningful equation, or inequality, must have the same dimensions on its left and right sides, a property known as dimensional homogeneity. Checking for dimensional homogeneity is a common application of dimensional analysis, serving as a plausibility check on derived equations and computations. It also serves as a guide and constraint in deriving equations that may describe a physical system in the absence of a more rigorous derivation. The concept of physical dimension, and of dimensional analysis, was introduced by Joseph Fourier in 1822.},

Five of the items have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale measures global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 5,024 high-school juniors and seniors from 10 randomly selected schools in New York State. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is considered a reliable and valid quantitative tool for self-esteem assessment.The RSES has been translated and adapted to various languages, such as Persian, French, Chinese, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.

  abstract = {The Big Five personality traits is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits, developed from the 1980s onwards in psychological trait theory. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, it reveals semantic associations: some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". These associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality, temperament and psyche.The theory identifies five factors: extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved) agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational) openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious) conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless) neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)The five factors may be remembered using the acronyms "OCEAN" or "CANOE". Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions. These traits are not black and white, but rather placed on continua.Family life and upbringing affects these traits. Twin studies and other research have shown that about half of the variation between individuals results from their genetic inheritance and half from their environment. Researchers have found conscientiousness, extraversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism to be relatively stable from middle age through old age.},

These so-called 'nested designs' yield data that cannot be considered to be independent, and so violate the independency assumption of conventional statistical methods such as the t test. Ignoring this dependency results in a probability of incorrectly concluding that an effect is statistically significant that is far higher (up to 80\%) than the nominal {$\alpha$} level (usually set at 5\%). We discuss the factors affecting the type I error rate and the statistical power in nested data, methods that accommodate dependency between observations and ways to determine the optimal study design when data are nested. Notably, optimization of experimental designs nearly always concerns collection of more truly independent observations, rather than more observations from one research object.},

In addition, we investigate a sequence of models that have an interaction effect and/or variable centering and derive expressions for the change in the regression coefficients between models from both an intuitive and mathematical perspective. We demonstrate how these topics may be employed to motivate discussion of other important areas, e.g., misspecification bias, multicollinearity, design of experiments, and regression surfaces. This paper presents a number of results also given elsewhere but in a form that gives a unified view of the topic. The examples cited are from the area of medical statistics.},

  abstract = {A review of the historical measurement theory literature in psychology reveals a recurring focus on a physical rather than a psychological model of the measurement process, whereas the active measurement research literature points to an emphasis on elements of a psychological measurement process. On the basis of the relevant portions of these anomalous findings the authors outline parts of a general measurement structure for psychology that begins with an essential theoretical base. The review first explores a century-old statement that developed a promising starting point within test development. This is followed by a diversionary statement based on physical measurement that mandated discussions of measurement in psychology to a physical model. The statement appeared to be countered by the theory of scale types (Stevens, 1946), which provided a promising element of the psychological measurement process. The legacy of the theory of scales, however, resulted in confusion and inconsistency about the specifics of psychological measurement. After reviewing some of the contributions in the research literature, a conciliation of the positive theory efforts of the past and the protocols for a measurement process are presented that is based upon the standard system of measurement (Aftanas, 1988, 2006) as the basic theoretically necessary element of measurement. The theoretical framework based on the standard system promises not only to integrate the components of measurement, and categories of psychological measurement that have been referenced in the past, but also to provide an easily assimilated protocol that can serve as a basis for future research and pedagogical exposition.},

The aim of the present paper is twofold: (A) comparing several Exploratory factor procedures (including the Procrustes rotation) to test what is the most appropriate one to analyse the replicability of the Five-factor structure, and (B) replicating the CFA results of the McCrae et al.\~Os study with a larger number of subjects. The normative American (N = 1000), and Spanish (2000) standardization samples of the NEO-PI-R, together with an independent university sample (N = 948) were analysed. Results were replicated in the three samples, and suggest that: (1) structural properties of the Five-factor model, as measured by the NEO-PI-R, are invariant irrespective of the Exploratory factor procedure used, and (2) when CFA limitations are surpassed, the Five-factor structure is supported.},

Compared to the NEO-FFI, reliability coefficients and factor structure was enhanced by the NEO-FFI-R and the NEO-60 in both samples, although substantial differences were not found. The factor structure of the NEO-60 shows the best fit since only three items do not load mainly on their own factor in both samples. Besides, correlations between items and NEO-PI-R domain scores are also higher for the items included in the NEO-60 version. On the other hand, convergent correlations with the NEO-PI-R dimensions were satisfactory irrespective of the version, and confirmatory factor analyses show slight differences among the different models generated after the three short versions.},

We describe four studies with seven samples of participants from three countries (total N = 319) in which the returns of recognized and unrecognized shares from several stock markets were tracked over various periods of time. We find no support for the claim that a simple strategy of name recognition can be used as a general strategy to select stocks that yield better-thanaverage returns. However, there was some suggestion in the data that recognition performs better when the market is falling and worse when it is rising. A follow-up study indicated that the absence of an overall recognition effect could not easily be attributed to our reliance on student participants or smaller samples than Borges et al. (1999) had used. We conclude that, with respect to changes in value, selecting stocks on the basis of name recognition is a near-random method of portfolio construction that offers little, if any, benefit to the personal investor.},

Methods for the estimation of power in two-level models have been based on formulas and Monte Carlo simulation. We provide a hands-on tutorial illustrating how a priori and post hoc power analyses for the most frequently used two-level models are conducted. We describe how a population model for the power analysis can be specified by using standardized input parameters and how the power analysis is implemented in SIMR, a very flexible power estimation method based on Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we provide case-sensitive rules of thumb for deriving sufficient sample sizes as well as minimum detectable effect sizes that yield a power {$\geq$} .80 for the effects and input parameters most frequently analyzed by psychologists. For medium variance components, the results indicate that with lower level (L1) sample sizes up to 30 and higher level (L2) sample sizes up to 200, medium and large fixed effects can be detected. However, small L2 direct- or cross-level interaction effects cannot be detected with up to 200 clusters. The tutorial and guidelines should be of help to researchers dealing with multilevel study designs such as individuals clustered within groups or repeated measurements clustered within individuals.

We explored whether these relationships were a priori predictable from the semantic properties of the survey items, using language processing algorithms which are now available as new research methods. Language processing algorithms were used to calculate the semantic similarity among all items in state-of-the-art surveys from Organisational Behaviour research. These surveys covered areas such as transformational leadership, work motivation and work outcomes. This information was used to explain and predict the response patterns from real subjects. Semantic algorithms explained 60\textendash 86\% of the variance in the response patterns and allowed remarkably precise prediction of survey responses from humans, except in a personality test. Even the relationships between independent and their purported dependent variables were accurately predicted. This raises concern about the empirical nature of data collected through some surveys if results are already given a priori through the way subjects are being asked. Survey response patterns seem heavily determined by semantics. Language algorithms may suggest these prior to administering a survey. This study suggests that semantic algorithms are becoming new tools for the social sciences, opening perspectives on survey responses that prevalent psychometric theory cannot explain.},

Applying a recently proposed semantic theory of survey response, we claim that survey responses tap two different sources: a mixture of attitudes plus the semantic structure of the survey. Exploring the degree to which individual responses are influenced by semantics, we hypothesized that in many cases, information about attitude strength is actually filtered out as noise in the commonly used correlation matrix. We developed a procedure to separate the semantic influence from attitude strength in individual response patterns, and compared these results to, respectively, the observed sample correlation matrices and the semantic similarity structures arising from text analysis algorithms. This was done with four datasets, comprising a total of 7,787 subjects and 27,461,502 observed item pair responses. As we argued, attitude strength seemed to account for much information about the individual respondents. However, this information did not seem to carry over into the observed sample correlation matrices, which instead converged around the semantic structures offered by the survey items. This is potentially disturbing for the traditional understanding of what survey data represent. We argue that this approach contributes to a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in survey responses. In turn, this could help us make better use of the data that such methods provide.},

This study starts with an introduction to the semantic theory of survey response (STSR) and proceeds by offering a guided approach to conducting such analyses. The reader is presented with two types of semantic algorithms and a brief overview of how they are calculated and how they can be accessed by interested researchers. Subsequently, we use semantic data to reanalyze a previously published study on the relationships between perceptions of a trainee program, intrinsic motivation, and work outcomes. The semantic algorithms can explain between 31 and 55\% of the variation in the observed correlations. This article shows how the statistical models originally used to explore the survey data can be replicated using semantics either alone or as an identifiable source of variation in the data. All the steps are presented in detail, and the datasets as well as the statistical syntax necessary to perform the analyses are made available to the readers.

While the experienced phenomenology has been investigated, there are no explanations about how one can have these experiences. Instead, the only recently discussed explanation suggests that the anecdotal phenomenology is due to memory effects and hence not really experienced during the accidents. The purpose of this article is i) to reintroduce the currently-forgotten comprehensively altered phenomenology that some people experience during the accidents, ii) to explain why the recent experiments fail to touch the issue at hand, and iii) to suggest a new framework to explain what happens when people experience time slowing down in these cases.

Therefore, each respondent gets only a subset of vignettes. These subsets may either be randomly selected in following the tradition of the factorial survey or systematically selected according to an experimental design. We show that these strategies in selecting vignette sets have strong implications for the analysis and interpretation of vignette data. Random selection strategies result in a random confounding of effects and heavily rely on the assumption of no interaction effects. In contrast, experimental strategies systematically confound interaction effects with main or set effects, thereby preserving a meaningful interpretation of main and important interaction effects. Using a pilot study on attitudes toward immigrants we demonstrate the implementation and analysis of a confounded factorial design.},

The disposition to trust has a limited ability to explain trust. Research, experience and common sense suggest that individuals \textendash{} despite having a relatively stable disposition to trust \textendash{} do not trust everyone equally in every situation. Benevolence is the extent to which the trustor believes the trustee is concerned about the trustor's well-being, apart from any self-interested motives. Affect-based trust was contrasted with cognition-based trust, or trust rooted in ability and integrity sorts of concepts. People are largely limited on the extent to which they can alter their appearance to in spire trust.},

Two dependent variables will often covary with each other because they are affected by a common independent variable. A state trace is a graph which plots the value of one dependent variable as a function of another. (Thus, a state trace is a generalization of the yes-no receiver-operating-characteristic curve.) By appropriately analyzing state traces, it is possible to test theories concerning (a) the mechanisms by which independent variables affect dependent variables and (b) how these mechanisms differ from one population of persons to another. As an illustration, a study of long-term memory in normal persons, schizophrenics, and persons with organic brain syndrome is presented. The effects of number of word presentations and length of retention interval upon probability of word recall and recognition were investigated. The results were analyzed by state-trace analysis.},

The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the hypothesis that attitude towards dreams is not related to DRF but that it influences the estimated DRF through a process of selective attention. A secondary goal was to evaluate the adequacy of Estimated DRF as a measure of diary DRF as well as in relation to Attitude Towards Dreams. Participants' (N=82) Attitude Towards Dreams and Estimated DRF were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire while diary DRF was calculated from a dream log. As predicted, Attitude Towards Dreams and diary DRF were independently related to Estimated DRF. In addition, estimations of DRF were found to be inaccurate; individuals with a negative attitude towards dreams were more likely to underestimate their diary DRF. The data show that the choice of DRF measures has a direct and significant impact on the pattern and magnitude of the relation between people's DRF and their Attitude Towards Dreams.},

Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects (RE) modeling\textemdash correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals\textemdash is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, RE can provide everything that FE promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Pl\"umper and Troeger's FE Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, RE models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using RE. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.},

  abstract = {Scientific knowledge as opposed to common-sense knowledge entails a methodological revolution based on a search not for essences, in Aristotelian sense, but for mathematical functions, in Galilean sense, originated from the controlled experiment and founded on the concept of a closed or isolated system. The Priestley-Lavoisier dispute is an historical example that shows clearly the disjunction between pre-science and science. This methodological revolution has not yet been achieved in the field of ``social sciences'' for the persisting prejudices about dualism between man and nature. Starting from this situation, the paper emphasizes the need for a definition of the research about man and society that overcomes the obstacles and the presuppositions of philosophical ideology and common sense, according to the distinctive features of scientific inquiry and the corresponding requirements for the scientific language. In particular, with reference to the language of every science, the condition of semantic homogeneity of predicates is analyzed, and the main misunderstandings deriving from the non-conformity to this basic criterion (that have so far not allowed a development of a real social science) are pointed out; namely: (a) the consideration of the languages that designate the different fields of research (economics, psychology and sociology) as pairwise disjoint sets, even if there are clear intersections among them, and (b) the resort within the current ``social sciences'' language to pseudofunctions, whose domain is a set of internal (cognitive) events, or a set of biological events, and the range is a set of external (behavioral) events. According to these remarks, some criticisms to McIntyre's paper, published in this issue, are formulated.},

This chapter argues that two key events contributed to the rapid expansion in popularity of the trait perspective and were instrumental in shaping how personality researchers think about traits to this day. These events were the introduction by Charles Spearman of the single common factor model, and later the extension of this model to multiple factors by Thurstone. Using Gigerenzer's "tools-to-theories" framework, the chapter traces: the development of the currently-dominant descriptive model in contemporary personality trait research, the Five-Factor Model (FFM), its continual interactions with factor analysis, and the later development of Five Factor Theory. The chapter describes the history and development of the FFM and highlights the ways in which factor analysis-to-personality trait psychology may represent a specific example of this heuristic. It focuses specifically on the role of variable selection and data prestructuring, rotational indeterminacy, the number of factors problem, and simple structure, in influencing the development of personality trait models and theory.

  abstract = {Emotional Intelligence (EI) is now widely used in organizations and graduate schools with an increase in published research supporting it. Discussion about EI whether based on measures or theory has given little distinction as to behavioral EI (i.e., how does EI appear in a person's actions). This results in spurious conflicts about the validity of the different theories or measures which likely limit predicting managerial and leadership effectiveness, engagement, innovation and organizational citizenship. By adding a behavioral level, the concept of EI could relate to work and life outcomes beyond general mental ability and personality traits, avoid some of the criticisms while providing a more holistic theory of EI. As such, EI exists within personality as a performance trait or ability, and a self-schema self-image and trait, and a set of behaviors (i.e., competencies). The main contribution of this establishing the behavioral EI with a multi-level theory, while explaining how to assess it, the benefits of such a concept and its psychometric validity and challenges. The history and assortment of validation studies will illustrate that measures can rigorously and effectively assess the behavioral level of EI.},

We show that there are interesting parallels and connections between the two, by focusing on a real and detailed example (temperature) from the history of science. More specifically, our novel approach is to study the issue of validity based on the history of measurement in physics, which will lead to three concrete points that are relevant for the validity debate in psychology. First of all, studying the causal mechanisms underlying the measurements can be crucial for evaluating whether the measurements are valid. Secondly, psychologists would benefit from focusing more on the robustness of measurements. Finally, we argue that it is possible to make good science based on (relatively) bad measurements, and that the explanatory success of science can contribute to justifying the validity of measurements.},

The roots of the case for linking magnitudes are based on the use to which magnitude information is put (action), the way in which we learn about magnitudes (ontogeny), shared properties and locations of magnitude processing neurons, the effects of brain lesions and behavioural interference studies. Here, we assess this idea in the context of a theory of magnitude, which proposed common processing mechanisms of time, space, number and other dimensions.},

It is now proposed that the brain represents time in a distributed manner and tells the time by detecting the coincidental activation of different neural populations.},

  abstract = {The normal distribution is a common model of randomness. Unlike the uniform distribution, it proposes a most probable value which is also the mean, while other values occur with a probability that decreases in a regular way with distance from the mean. This behavior is mathematically very satisfying, and has an easily observed correspondence with many physical processes. One drawback of the normal distribution, however, is that it supplies a positive probability density to every value in the range (-{$\infty$}, +{$\infty$}), although the actual probability of an extreme event will be very low. In many cases, it is desired to use the normal distribution to describe the random variation of a quantity that, for physical reasons, must be strictly positive. A mathematically defensible way to preserve the main features of the normal distribution while avoiding extreme values involves the truncated normal distribution, in which the range of definition is made finite at one or both ends of the interval. It is the purpose of this report to describe the truncation process, to consider how certain basic statistical properties of the new distribution can be determined, to show how to efficiently sample the distribution, and how to construct an associated quadrature rule, or even a sparse grid quadrature rule for a problem with multidimensional randomness.},

In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

Since the 1970s tolerance has had important manifestations in cultural and legal settings. In Dutch criminal justice policy, tolerance not only refers generally to leniency regarding (petty) crime but also means that government in some circumstances does not prosecute specified infractions of statutory law. This tradition made possible distinctive Dutch ways of handling problems such as drugs, prostitution, and euthanasia. Dutch tolerance makes it possible to differentiate between dangerous and less dangerous forms of questionable behavior and to focus less on moral judgments. Tolerance has not impeded efforts against organized crime, nor has it much influenced levels of drug abuse or medical end-of-life decisions. Dutch policies in some of these fields are more effective than those in other Western countries. Rising criticism of legal tolerance coincides with a decline of cultural tolerance in general. Some blame official tolerance for recent ethnic difficulties involving the rapidly growing Muslim minority.}

Research into both of these areas is relatively new, and while several reviews have emerged for each area independently, none has directly proposed a conceptual integration. The current review explores how key axioms and assumptions of traditional psychological models of emotion regulation and the psychological interventions that are derived from them (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy) differ fundamentally from mindfulness-based approaches in terms of the underlying processes they address. Accordingly, mindfulness and emotion regulation are each reviewed, followed by a conceptual integration. Fundamental difficulties arising from the attempt to integrate the two domains are highlighted, especially as to the ``reality'' of thoughts, the relationship between thoughts and emotions, and the need to move beyond a valence model of emotion. Finally, a model is proposed outlining the likely critical processes and mechanisms that underlie ``mindful emotion regulation.'' \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In a discussion that brings together the history of science with the philosophy of science, Chang presents the simple eet challenging epistemic and technical questions about these instruments, and the complex web of abstract philosophical issues surrounding them. Chang's book shows that many items of knowledge that we take for granted now are in fact spectacular achievements, obtained only after a great deal of innovative thinking, painstaking experiments, bold conjectures, and controversy. Lurking behind these achievements are some very important philosophical questions about how and when people accept the authority of science.},

  abstract = {Abstract. If whiggism involves judging past scientific theories according to our modern standards, not many people have been properly whiggish about the Chemical Revolution. From a modern perspective, Lavoisier's theory is just as wrong as advanced versions of the phlogiston theory. Three of the central pillars of Lavoisier's system are clearly at odds with modern chemistry: the oxygen theory of acidity, the caloric theory of heat (which also explained the three states of matter), and the theory of combustion (especially with regard to the production of heat and light). On the other hand, if we examine Lavoisier's lasting contributions, we find that various phlogistonists anticipated or outdid Lavoisier (e.g. Cavendish on precise weight measurements, and Priestley on the role of oxygen in combustion and physiology). The real problem with the much-reviled traditional historiography of the Chemical Revolution (and of much else) is not whiggism, but a crude triumphalism, which unreflectively continues to celebrate what was once victorious in the past. The misidentification of this triumphalism as whiggism has confounded critics, sending them off into a total renunciation of judgement regarding the scientific merits of past ideas. I propose a two-part corrective to this misguided critique. First, the most straightforward and effective antidote to triumphalism is a historiographical pluralism that pays conscious attention to the losers. Second, and more broadly, there is much to be gained from an `independent judgementalism' in historiography, which restores the role of the historian as a responsible free agent.},

  abstract = {Abstract. If whiggism involves judging past scientific theories according to our modern standards, not many people have been properly whiggish about the Chemical Revolution. From a modern perspective, Lavoisier's theory is just as wrong as advanced versions of the phlogiston theory. Three of the central pillars of Lavoisier's system are clearly at odds with modern chemistry: the oxygen theory of acidity, the caloric theory of heat (which also explained the three states of matter), and the theory of combustion (especially with regard to the production of heat and light). On the other hand, if we examine Lavoisier's lasting contributions, we find that various phlogistonists anticipated or outdid Lavoisier (e.g. Cavendish on precise weight measurements, and Priestley on the role of oxygen in combustion and physiology). The real problem with the much-reviled traditional historiography of the Chemical Revolution (and of much else) is not whiggism, but a crude triumphalism, which unreflectively continues to celebrate what was once victorious in the past. The misidentification of this triumphalism as whiggism has confounded critics, sending them off into a total renunciation of judgement regarding the scientific merits of past ideas. I propose a two-part corrective to this misguided critique. First, the most straightforward and effective antidote to triumphalism is a historiographical pluralism that pays conscious attention to the losers. Second, and more broadly, there is much to be gained from an `independent judgementalism' in historiography, which restores the role of the historian as a responsible free agent.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder. Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults ({$\geq$}18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20\% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291. Findings We identified 28\hphantom{,}552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116\hphantom{,}477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2{$\cdot$}13 (95\% credible interval [CrI] 1{$\cdot$}89\textendash 2{$\cdot$}41) for amitriptyline and 1{$\cdot$}37 (1{$\cdot$}16\textendash 1{$\cdot$}63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0{$\cdot$}84, 95\% CrI 0{$\cdot$}72\textendash 0{$\cdot$}97) and fluoxetine (0{$\cdot$}88, 0{$\cdot$}80\textendash 0{$\cdot$}96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1{$\cdot$}30, 1{$\cdot$}01\textendash 1{$\cdot$}68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1{$\cdot$}15 to 1{$\cdot$}55 for efficacy and from 0{$\cdot$}64 to 0{$\cdot$}83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1{$\cdot$}19\textendash 1{$\cdot$}96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0{$\cdot$}51\textendash 0{$\cdot$}84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0{$\cdot$}43\textendash 0{$\cdot$}77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1{$\cdot$}30\textendash 2{$\cdot$}32). 46 (9\%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73\%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18\%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low. Interpretation All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants.

Self consciousness consists of three dimensions, private self consciousness, public self consciousness, and social anxiety. Whereas private self consciousness seems only remotely related to guilt proneness, public self consciousness and social anxiety appear to be closely associated with the likelihood of feeling shame or embarrassment. The associations of dimensions of self consciousness with guilt and shame and with dimensions assessed by the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire were ascertained. Private self consciousness was unrelated to measures of guilt and shame or to neuroticism, but (somewhat surprisingly) positively related to psychoticism. Public self consciousness and social anxiety were positively related to shame and to neuroticism. These data, like earlier results, suggest that neuroticism is not associated with individuals' concerns regarding failures to fulfill moral obligations (the `social contract') but, instead, with high degrees of concern regarding loss of status.},

The present study tested how well these 25 facets could be integrated with the 10-factor structure of traits within the Big Five that is operationalized by the Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS). In two healthy adult samples, 10-factor solutions largely confirmed our hypothesis that each of the 10 BFAS scales would be the highest loading BFAS scale on one and only one factor. Varying numbers of PID-5 scales were additional markers of each factor, and the overall factor structure in the first sample was well replicated in the second. Our results allow Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T) to be brought to bear on manifestations of personality disorder, because CB5T offers mechanistic explanations of the 10 factors measured by the BFAS. Future research, therefore, may begin to test hypotheses derived from CB5T regarding the mechanisms that are dysfunctional in specific personality disorders.},

Across four experiments we found: (1) frequency judgments regarding one list were biased by the second, (2) manipulating encoding between lists improved source monitoring and resulted in more accurate judgments, (3) manipulating item context between lists improved source monitoring and resulted in more accurate judgments, but only when the context was item specific, and (4) manipulating simplebackground context between lists was ineffective at improving source monitoring.},

By convention, the principal techniques used to identify such processes are based on functional dissociation\textemdash the observation of selective effects of variables on tasks. Yet, despite their widespread use, the inferential logic associated with these techniques is flawed. The aims of this article are twofold: (a) to review and make explicit the inferential limits of single and double dissociation; and (b) to introduce a new technique that overcomes these limits. Called reversed association, this new technique is defined as any nonmonotonic relation between two tasks of interest. We argue that reversed association, in place of functional dissociation, offers a sounder basis for inferring the number of functionally independent processes underlying performance and, having fewer assumptions, offers researchers greater scope for discovering such processes and determining their nature and effects.

SDA is based on geometric properties of the combination of latent variables that are preserved under arbitrary monotonic transformation and requires estimation neither of these variables nor of the monotonic functions. The aim of the present paper is to connect SDA to the mathematical theory of oriented matroids. This serves to situate SDA within an existing formalism, to clarify its conceptual foundation, and to solve outstanding conjectures. We describe the theory of oriented matroids as it applies to SDA and derive tests for both linear and nonlinear models. In addition, we show that state-trace analysis is a special case of SDA which we extend to models such as additive conjoint measurement where each dependent variable is the same unspecified monotonic function of a linear combination of latent variables. Lastly, we show how measurement error can be accommodated based on the model-fitting approach developed by Kalish et~al. (2016).},

One problematic feature of these models is their failure to converge under maximal (or even near-maximal) random effects structures. The lack of convergence is relatively unaddressed in linguistics and when it is addressed has resulted in statistical practices (e.g. Jaeger, 2009; Gries, 2015; Bates, et al, 2015b) that are premised on the idea that non-convergence is an indication that a random effects structure is over-specified (or not parsimonious), the parsimonious convergence hypothesis (PCH). We test the PCH by running simulations in lme4 under two sets of assumptions for both a linear dependent variable and a binary dependent variable in order to assess the rate of non-convergence for both types of mixed effects models when a known maximal effect structure is used to generate the data (i.e. when non-convergence cannot be explained by random effects with zero variance). Under the PCH, lack of convergence is treated as evidence against a more maximal random effects structure, but that result is not upheld with our simulations. We provide an alternative model, fully specified Bayesian models implemented in rstan (Stan Development Team, 2016; Carpenter, et al, in press) that removed the convergence problems almost entirely in simulations of the same conditions. These results indicate that when there is known non-zero variance for all slopes and intercepts, under realistic distributions of data and with moderate to severe imbalance, mixed effects models in lme4 have moderate to high non-convergence rates which can cause linguistic researchers to wrongfully exclude random effect terms.},

In this article, we argue that the root cause of the theory crisis is that developing good psychological theories is extremely difficult and that understanding the reasons why it is so difficult is crucial for moving forward in the theory crisis. We discuss three key reasons based on philosophy of science for why developing good psychological theories is so hard: the relative lack of robust phenomena that impose constraints on possible theories, problems of validity of psychological constructs, and obstacles to discovering causal relationships between psychological variables. We conclude with recommendations on how to move past the theory crisis.},

  abstract = {Our society celebrates failure as a teachable moment. Yet in five studies (total N = 1,674), failure did the opposite: It undermined learning. Across studies, participants answered binary-choice questions, following which they were told they answered correctly (success feedback) or incorrectly (failure feedback). Both types of feedback conveyed the correct answer, because there were only two answer choices. However, on a follow-up test, participants learned less from failure feedback than from success feedback. This effect was replicated across professional, linguistic, and social domains\textemdash even when learning from failure was less cognitively taxing than learning from success and even when learning was incentivized. Participants who received failure feedback also remembered fewer of their answer choices. Why does failure undermine learning? Failure is ego threatening, which causes people to tune out. Participants learned less from personal failure than from personal success, yet they learned just as much from other people's failure as from others' success. Thus, when ego concerns are muted, people tune in and learn from failure.},

In addition, we examined whether state anger, state rumination, and state empathy mediate this relationship. Using a large sample (N=1040), we found that admiration was negatively related to revenge and avoidance via higher empathy for the transgressor. By contrast, rivalry was positively related to revenge and avoidance via greater anger and rumination and less empathy. Findings suggest that the mechanisms through which narcissism and lack of forgiveness are associated are better understood if we disentangle admiration and rivalry and consider both cognitive and affective antecedents of narcissists' unforgiving motivations.},

  abstract = {Many practical problems of quality control involve the use of ordinal scales. Questionnaires planned to collect judgments on qualitative or linguistic scales, whose levels are terms such as ``good,' ' ``bad,' ' ``medium,' ' etc., are extensively used both in evaluating service quality and in visual controls for manufacturing industry. In an ordinal environment, the concept of distance between two generic levels of the same scale is not defined. Therefore, a population (universe) of judgments cannot be described using ``traditional' ' statistical distributions since they are based on the notion of distance. The concept of ``distribution shape'' cannot be defined as well. In this article, we introduce a new statistical entity, the so-called ordinal distribution, to describe a population of judgments expressed on an ordinal scale. We also discuss which of the traditional location and dispersion measures can be used in this context and we briefly analyze some of their properties. A new dispersion measure, the ordinal range, as an extension of the cardinal range to ordinal scales, is then proposed. A practical application in the field of quality is developed throughout the article.},

Block is one of the most influential personality and developmental psychologists of his generation and of the 20th century; at the same time, he established himself as a pioneer and authority on applications of multivariate statistics to psychological data. Block became involved with an existing longitudinal research project at Berkeley, found insightful ways to bring order out of previously unused anecdotal and informal data, and used it to publish the influential Lives through time (1971, Bancroft). Equally important were Block's contributions to statistical methodology and personality assessment. The challenge of response sets (1965, Appleton-Century-Crofts) nearly single-handedly restored confidence in substantive interpretations of self-report measures of personality; and his demonstrations of the utility of observer evaluations and elaboration of the Q-sort method (The Q-sort method in personality assessment and psychiatric research, 1961, Thomas) helped establish the knowledgeable observer as a valuable source of psychological information. Block was ahead of his time on two other major analytic issues: latent variable modeling and empirical sampling distributions for statistical inference. Block also became well-known for his energetic participation in research controversies. As a key participant in the ``person\textendash situation debate,'' he argued for the lifelong coherence of personality. After decades of health challenges, he insisted on being taken home, where he could be surrounded by his music, his art, and his family and where he died on January 13, 2010.

  abstract = {Noradrenaline, essential for the modulation of memory, is released in various parts of the brain from nerve terminals controlled by the locus coeruleus (LoC). Noradrenaline release consequent upon input from higher brain areas also occurs within the LoC itself. We examined the effect of noradrenaline on adrenergic receptors in the LoC on memory processing, using colored bead discrimination learning in the young domestic chick. We have shown previously that the release of noradrenaline in the hippocampus and cortex (mesopallium) is essential for acquisition and consolidation of short-term to intermediate and to long-term memory. Noradrenaline release within the LoC is triggered by the glutamatergic input from the forebrain. Inhibition by LoC injection of NMDA or AMPA receptor antagonists is rescued by injection of {$\beta$}2-and {$\beta$}3-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists in the hippocampus. We show that inhibition of {$\alpha$}2A-ARs by BRL44408 in the LoC up to 30 min post-training consolidates weakly-reinforced learning. Conversely activation of {$\alpha$}2A-ARs in the LoC at the times of consolidation between short-term and intermediate and long-term memory caused memory loss, which is likely to be due to a decreased release of noradrenaline within these two time windows. The {$\alpha$}2A-AR antagonist will block presynaptic inhibitory receptors leading to an increase in extracellular noradrenaline. This interpretation is supported by the actions of noradrenaline uptake blockers that produce the same memory outcome. BRL44408 in the mesopallium also caused memory enhancement. {$\beta$}2-ARs are important in the first time window, whereas {$\alpha$}1-, {$\alpha$}2C-and {$\beta$}3-ARs are important in the second time window. The results reveal that for successful memory formation noradrenaline release is necessary within the LoC as well as in other brain regions, at the time of consolidation of memory from short-term to intermediate and from intermediate to long-term memory. \textcopyright{} 2010 IBRO.},

As a consequence, in some parts of psychology, theories have become replaced by surrogates, such as circular restatements of the phenomenon, one-word explanations, and lists of general dichotomies. Moving backwards from existing models to labels is an odd event in science, which typically progresses in the opposite direction.

Suggested explanations include discrimination, and differences in preferences and human capital. In this paper we present experimental evidence in support of an additional explanation: When women and men compete against one another, women may perform less well than men, even if they perform similarly in noncompetitive environments. We observe a significantly higher gender gap in performance in mixed sex tournaments, than when participants are paid piece rates: This is driven by a large and significant increase in the performance of men, that of women is unchanged. This gender gap is not due to gender differences in risk aversion. We then have men and women compete in single sex tournaments, to investigate whether women under-perform only when competing against men. Women do indeed increase their performance and gender differences in mean performance are now insignificant. Hence women can be observed to perform well in competitive environments, but less so in mixed gender ones. These results may be due to lower skill of women, or more likely to the fact that women dislike competition, or alternatively that they feel less competent than their male competitors, which depresses their performance in mixed tournaments. Our last experiment provides support for this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Introduction Human personality is described preferentially in terms of factors (dimensions) found using factor analysis. An alternative and highly related method is network analysis, which may have several advantages over factor analytic methods. Aim To directly compare the ability of network community detection (NCD) and principal component factor analysis (PCA) to examine modularity in multidimensional datasets such as the neuroticism-extraversion-openness personality inventory revised (NEO-PI-R). Methods 434 healthy subjects were tested on the NEO-PI-R. PCA was performed to extract factor structures (FS) of the current dataset using both item scores and facet scores. Correlational network graphs were constructed from univariate correlation matrices of interactions between both items and facets. These networks were pruned in a link-by-link fashion while calculating the network community structure (NCS) of each resulting network using the Wakita Tsurumi clustering algorithm. NCSs were matched against FS and networks of best matches were kept for further analysis. Results At facet level, NCS showed a best match (96.2\%) with a `confirmatory' 5-FS. At item level, NCS showed a best match (80\%) with the standard 5-FS and involved a total of 6 network clusters. Lesser matches were found with `confirmatory' 5-FS and `exploratory' 6-FS of the current dataset. Network analysis did not identify facets as a separate level of organization in between items and clusters. A small-world network structure was found in both item- and facet level networks. Conclusion We present the first optimized network graph of personality traits according to the NEO-PI-R: a `Personality Web'. Such a web may represent the possible routes that subjects can take during personality development. NCD outperforms PCA by producing plausible modularity at item level in non-standard datasets, and can identify the key roles of individual items and clusters in the network.},

The present paper will deal with the analysis of curves that result when the difference between experimental treatments involves a scaled independent variable with equal steps (or equal-logarithmic steps) between levels of the independent variable. Examples would be learning curves, extinction curves, dark adaptation curves, time-to-attain a level of dark adaptation as a function of the luminance of the preadaptation field, response rate as a function of the amount of reinforcement, etc. The procedures apply to most curves or sets of curves in which y, the dependent variable, is plotted as a function of x, the independent variable, where there are equal intervals between the values of x. It is assumed that there is random normal variation in the dependent variable at each data point with equal error variances. There may or may not be parameters expressing qualitative or quantitative variation of additional independent variables that are orthogonal to x.

It is argued here that this is a highly unlikely scenario in psychology given the contingent and opportunistic character of the processes that brought its original topics together into a new discipline, and the nearly continuous institutional, social, and even political negotiating and horse-trading that has determined psychology's ``boundaries'' in the 14 decades since. Psychology, as the field currently stands, does not have the intellectual coherence to be brought together by any set of principles that would enable its phenomena to be captured and explained as rigorous products of those principles. If there is a kind of unification in psychology's future, it is more likely to be one that, paradoxically, sees it broken up into a number of large ``super-subdisciplines,'' each of which exhibits more internal coherence than does the current sprawling and heterogeneous whole.},

This development was spearheaded by a few highly influential introductory articles that ( i) showed how these regression models are superior to what was the previous gold standard and, perhaps even more importantly, ( ii) showed how these models are used practically. Corpus linguistics can benefit from mixed-effects/multi-level models for the same reason that psycholinguistics can - because, for example, speaker-specific and lexically specific idiosyncrasies can be accounted for elegantly; but, in fact, corpus linguistics needs them even more because ( i) corpus-linguistic data are observational and, thus, usually unbalanced and messy/noisy, and ( ii) most widely used corpora come with a hierarchical structure that corpus linguists routinely fail to consider. Unlike nearly all overviews of mixed-effects/multi-level modelling, this paper is specifically written for corpus linguists to get more of them to start using these techniques more. After a short methodological history, I provide a non-technical introduction to mixed-effects models and then discuss in detail one example - particle placement in English - to show how mixed-effects/multi-level modelling results can be obtained and how they are far superior to those of traditional regression modelling.},

With regard to the former, we have seen that the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable sources and of smart grids requires energy storage capabilities suitable for providing services with different technoeconomical horizons, such as sag compensation, frequency regulation, power smoothing, load leveling, load following, grid stabilization, power balancing, peak shaving, and time shifting up to investment deferral. With regard to the latter, the tremendous worldwide success of mobile electronics (cell phones, smartphones, laptops, etc.) in part relies on batteries capable of high power and energy densities. An even wider market expansion is expected in the coming years from electric vehicles, which demand batteries that feature high ranges at low costs. In this framework, intense efforts are being devoted to the development of improved batteries, with the aim of capturing a market that is expected to boom in the coming decades [1], [2]. However, apart from being expected to thrive in a bright future, batteries also boast a glorious past.},

Yet, the design of classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how               conjoint analysis               , an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established \textendash{} and thus those tasks become popular \textendash{} when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects \textendash{} low between-participant variability \textendash{} makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

A slight primacy effect was found in all 3 studies. Results were consistent with a 2-stage consolidation theory of memory. (22 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Dependent variables were: judgment of frequency (JOF), judgment of duration (JOD), recognition performance, and free recall. JOF, recognition, and free recall were highly correlated with F, but relatively unaffected by D. JOD, in contrast, was affected by both F and D, showing that D does have an effect on memory. It is suggested that JOF is based on the strength of the long-term memory trace, while JOD is based partly on strength and partly on an independent dimension of the trace related to D. The total-time hypothesis does not appear to hold when D is manipulated within lists.},

Shiffrin (see record 1972-10191-001) that complex visual scenes are not rehearsed in testing the hypothesis that the effect of spacing on memory is due to rehearsal. In Exp I with 27 paid volunteers, a list of vacation slides was presented in which both the number of repetitions and the spacing of repetitions were varied. Subsequent frequency judgments showed an effect of spacing much like that found using verbal materials. In Exp II and III with 35 and 41 Ss, respectively, effects of filled and unfilled spacing intervals were compared, and it was concluded that the spacing effect is primarily a function of the duration of the spacing interval. No evidence supported the notion that pictures are rehearsed. Rehearsal apparently cannot play the key role in an adequate, completely general explanation of the spacing effect.

In Experiment II, pictures were given M massed presentations just prior to the P(M)-P(M+1) spacing interval. The form of the spacing curve was independent of M. Neither experiment confirmed the prediction of "overhabituation," derived from the habituation-recovery explanation of the spacing effect. In Experiment III, subjects made both duration and frequency judgments. The duration judgment results were not consistent with the notion that subjects remember multiple massed presentations as single occurrences of especially long duration. Some evidence from Experiments I and III suggests that an interrupted stimulus is recognized better than one that is not interrupted-a finding that, if replicable, would support the habituation-recovery account of the spacing effect.},

Two hypotheses were contrasted: (1) that strong items seem more recent than weak items (theactivation hypothesis), and (2) that JORs are more accurate for strong items than for weak items (theaccuracy hypothesis). Results of both experiments supported the activation hypothesis. On the basis of these and previous results, it is argued that recency is inferred partly from a memory's strength or activation and partly from some other time-related clue to the age of the memory.},

  abstract = {Perception is a product of evolution. Our perceptual systems, like our limbs and livers, have been shaped by natural selection. The effects of selection on perception can be studied using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms. To this end, we define and classify perceptual strategies and allow them to compete in evolutionary games in a variety of worlds with a variety of fitness functions. We find that veridical perceptions--strategies tuned to the true structure of the world--are routinely dominated by nonveridical strategies tuned to fitness. Veridical perceptions escape extinction only if fitness varies monotonically with truth. Thus, a perceptual strategy favored by selection is best thought of not as a window on truth but as akin to a windows interface of a PC. Just as the color and shape of an icon for a text file do not entail that the text file itself has a color or shape, so also our perceptions of space-time and objects do not entail (by the Invention of Space-Time Theorem) that objective reality has the structure of space-time and objects. An interface serves to guide useful actions, not to resemble truth. Indeed, an interface hides the truth; for someone editing a paper or photo, seeing transistors and firmware is an irrelevant hindrance. For the perceptions of H. sapiens, space-time is the desktop and physical objects are the icons. Our perceptions of space-time and objects have been shaped by natural selection to hide the truth and guide adaptive behaviors. Perception is an adaptive interface.},

  abstract = {Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an empathogen, and D-amphetamine is a classic stimulant. All three substances are used recreationally. LSD and MDMA are being investigated as medications to assist psychotherapy, and D-amphetamine is used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. All three substances induce distinct acute subjective effects. However, differences in acute responses to these prototypical psychoactive substances have not been characterized in a controlled study. We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, and endocrine effects of single doses of LSD (0.1\,mg), MDMA (125\,mg), D-amphetamine (40\,mg), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in 28 healthy subjects. All of the substances produced comparable increases in hemodynamic effects, body temperature, and pupil size, indicating equivalent autonomic responses at the doses used. LSD and MDMA increased heart rate more than D-amphetamine, and D-amphetamine increased blood pressure more than LSD and MDMA. LSD induced significantly higher ratings on the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale and Mystical Experience Questionnaire than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also produced greater subjective drug effects, ego dissolution, introversion, emotional excitation, anxiety, and inactivity than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also induced greater impairments in subjective ratings of concentration, sense of time, and speed of thinking compared with MDMA and D-amphetamine. MDMA produced greater ratings of good drug effects, liking, high, and ego dissolution compared with D-amphetamine. D-Amphetamine increased ratings of activity and concentration compared with LSD. MDMA but not LSD or D-amphetamine increased plasma concentrations of oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These results indicate clearly distinct acute effects of LSD, MDMA, and D-amphetamine and may assist the dose-finding in substance-assisted psychotherapy research.},

  abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre\textemdash layout (or conventional) and layout\textemdash specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

We apply their recommendations for the comprehensive assessment of structural validity to a uniquely large and varied dataset (N = 144496 experimental sessions) to investigate the psychometric properties of some of the most widely used self-report measures (k = 15 questionnaires, 26 subscales) in social and personality psychology. When assessed using the modal practice of considering only their internal consistency, 89\% of scales appeared to possess good validity. Yet, when validity was assessed comprehensively (via internal consistency, immediate and delayed test-retest reliability, factor structure, and measurement invariance for median age and gender) only 4\% demonstrated good validity. Furthermore, the less commonly a test is reported in the literature, the more likely it was to be failed (e.g., measurement invariance). This suggests that the pattern of under- reporting in the field may represent widespread hidden invalidity of the measures we use, and therefore pose a threat to many research findings. We highlight the degrees of freedom afforded to researchers in the assessment and reporting of structural validity. Similar to the better-known concept of p-hacking, we introduce the concept of validity hacking (v-hacking) and argue that it should be acknowledged and addressed.},

Many researchers use mean centered variables because they believe it's the thing to do or because reviewers ask them to, without quite understanding why. Adding to the confusion is the fact that there is also a perspective in the literature that mean centering does not reduce multicollinearity. In this article, we clarify the issues and reconcile the discrepancy. We distinguish between ``micro'' and ``macro'' definitions of multicollinearity and show how both sides of such a debate can be correct. To do so, we use proofs, an illustrative dataset, and a Monte Carlo simulation to show the precise effects of mean centering on both individual correlation coefficients as well as overall model indices. We hope to contribute to the literature by clarifying the issues, reconciling the two perspectives, and quelling the current confusion regarding whether and how mean centering can be a useful practice.},

  abstract = {The first version of this chapter (John, 1990) offered a comprehensive and detailed review of most of the available research. This is no longer possible as we are writing this chapter in 2007. What has happened? Figure 4.1 uses publication trends over the past 25 years to illustrate how fundamentally the field has changed. Specifically, we show the number of publications related to the Big Five personality traits for each 5-year interval, beginning in the early 1980s, obtained from keyword searches of the PsycINFO database. To provide a comparison, we also show the publication trend for the influential models developed earlier by Cattell and by Eysenck. Although both were then close to retirement age, their influence had continued during the 1980s. In fact, both Cattell (1990) and Eysenck (1990) had written chapters on personality traits for the first edition of this handbook. What did we expect to find? Our intuitions suggested that publications on the Big Five had increased substantially since the mid-1980s, with Cattell's and Eysenck's influence decreasing. But we were surprised by the data. First, the ascent of the Big Five happened much more gradually than we had expected, and Cattell's and Eysenck's influence held steady much longer. As Figure 4.1 shows, it took until the late 1990s for the number of Big Five publications to finally overtake the two older models. Second, whereas references to Cattell and Eysenck models have finally begun to decline in absolute numbers, their decline has been small compared to the amazing increase in research publications on the Big Five. By 2006, the last year for which we had figures available, the number of Big Five publications exceeded 300 per year, compared with less than 50 for the two older models. In the 9 years since the previous version of this chapter (John \& Srivastava, 1999) was completed, almost 2,000 new publications on the Big Five have appeared. As a result, we can now cover only a small fraction of all the relevant work in this chapter. Our main goal remains to provide a general overview and introduction to the field that focuses on the main issues and can serve as a useful reference resource. We therefore refer the reader to more specialized sources or reviews as needed. We begin our chapter with the history of the Big Five, including the discovery of the five dimensions, research replicating and extending the model, its convergence with research in the questionnaire tradition, and the development of several instruments to measure the Big Five. Then we compare three of the most frequently used instruments and discuss some new data regarding their reliability and validity. Finally, we address a number of conceptual issues, including how the Big Five taxonomy is structured hierarchically, how the five dimensions develop, whether they predict important life outcomes, and whether they are descriptive or explanatory concepts.

Monotonicityallows items to be interpreted as measuring a trait,and it allows for a general theory of nonparametricinference for traits. This theory is based on monotonelikelihood ratio and stochastic ordering properties.Thus, confirming the monotonicity assumption isessential to applications of nonparametric itemresponse models. The results of two methods ofevaluating monotonicity are presented: regressingindividual item scores on the total test score andon the `rest' score, which is obtained by omittingthe selected item from the total test score. It wasfound that the item-total regressions of some familiardichotomous item response models with monotoneIRFs exhibited nonmonotonicities that persist as thetest length increased. However, item-rest regressionsnever exhibited nonmonotonicities under the nonparametricmonotone unidimensional item responsemodel. The implications of these results for exploratoryanalysis of dichotomous item response dataand the application of these results to polytomousitem response data are discussed.},

Two experiments contrast the processing of simpler versus more complex sentences. The two more complex sentence types, object-relative center-embedded sentences and filler-gap sentences, not only take longer to process than their simpler counterparts, but they also produce a larger change in pupil diameter. We propose that the pupillary response is an indicator of how intensely the processing system is operating. The more complex sentences evoke some intense processing at the point in the sentence where a syntactic complexity is first encountered. The gaze durations at these points are elevated, indicating the immediate response to the demand of the syntactic processing. The pupil then starts to dilate, reaching a maximal diameter approximately 1.3 s later. The results from these various performance measures are integrated within a resource-limited computational model of comprehension. The paper develops a model of comprehension that includes an intensity dimension of thought, drawing a correspondence between the computational model's consumption of resources and the human pupillary response.},

At retrieval, studied and new stimuli were rated as novel, familiar (strong, moderate, or weak), or recollected. We found that both pupil response and fixation patterns at encoding predict later recognition memory strength. The extent of pupillary response accompanying incidental encoding was found to be predictive of subsequent memory. In addition, the number of fixations was also predictive of later recognition memory strength, suggesting that the accumulation of greater visual detail, even for single objects, is critical for the creation of a strong memory. Moreover, fixation patterns at encoding distinguished between recollection and familiarity at retrieval, with more dispersed fixations predicting familiarity and more clustered fixations predicting recollection. These data reveal close links between the autonomic control of pupil responses and eye movement patterns on the one hand and memory encoding on the other. Moreover, the data illustrate quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the incidental visual processing of stimuli, which are differentially predictive of the strength and the kind of memory experienced at recognition.},

In both experiments, the use of a modified remember/know procedure led to high confidence and matched accuracy levels characterising strong familiarity (F3) and recollection (R) responses. In Experiment 1, visual scanning behaviour at retrieval distinguished familiarity-based from recollection-based recognition. Recollection, relative to strength-matched familiarity, involved significantly larger pupil dilations and more dispersed fixation patterns. In Experiment 2, the hippocampus was selectively activated for recollected stimuli, while no evidence of activation was observed in the hippocampus for strong familiarity of matched accuracy. Recollection also activated the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), while the adjacent perirhinal cortex (PRC) was actively engaged in response to strong familiarity (than to recollection). Activity in prefrontal and parietal areas differentiated familiarity and recollection in both the extent and the magnitude of activity they exhibited, while the dorsomedial thalamus showed selective familiarity-related activity, and the ventrolateral and anterior thalamus selective recollection-related activity. These findings are consistent with the view that the hippocampus and PRC play contrasting roles in supporting recollection and familiarity and that these differences are not a result of differences in memory strength. Overall, the combined pupil dilation, eye movement and fMRI data suggest the operation of recognition mechanisms drawing differentially on familiarity and recollection, whose neural bases are distinct within the MTL. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

We present structural loadings for all trait facets organized into respective FFM-trait domain (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness). Both hierarchical second-order and bi-factor models showed tolerable model fit indices, using confirmatory factor analysis in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Some facet traits were substantially more representative than others for their respective trait domain, which facilitate further discussions on FFM-construct content. We conclude that IPIP-NEO is sufficiently structurally robust for future use, for the benefit of research and practice in personality assessment.},

Our method does not require prespecified, yet usually unknowable, population values of certain parameters for certain types of distributions, thus offering advantages compared to commonly used approaches to sample size planning. Importantly, we make our developments in a distribution-free environment and thus do not make untenable assumptions about the population from which observations are sampled. Our work is thus very general, timely due to the interest in effect sizes, and has wide applicability in the context of estimation of a general class of effect sizes.

Stimuli were presented both aurally and visually, controlling for all known visual influences on pupil diameter. The patterns of dilation were similar for both aural and visual presentation for all three tasks, but the magnitudes of pupil response were greater for aural presentation.

  abstract = {In recent years there has been increasing evidence that some antihypertensive drugs like clonidine and ??-methyldopa (after conversion in the brain to ??-methylnorepinephrine) may decrease sympathetic tone by stimulating central nervous system (CNS) ??2-adrenoceptors. These same drugs also produce pupillary dilation in cats and rats. In this review, evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that clonidinelike drugs act either directly or indirectly on CNS postsynaptic ??2-adrenoceptors to cause pupillary dilation by reduction of parasympathetic neural tone to the iris. It is further suggested that the underlying physiologic mechanism for this mydriatic action is activation of an ascending pathway that provides tonic inhibitory input by releasing norepinephrine on neurons in the Edinger-Westphal complex. Yohimbine-sensitive pupillary dilation in these species may provide a simple and effective model for quantitatively accessing CNS ??2-adrenoceptor activity. ?? 1986.},

The recent failure to replicate allegedly well-established NHST-results, however, implies that such results lack sufficient statistical power, and thus feature unacceptably high error-rates. Using data-simulation to estimate the error-rates of NHST-results, we advocate the research program strategy (RPS) as a superior methodology. RPS integrates Frequentist with Bayesian inference elements, and leads from a preliminary discovery against a (random) H0-hypothesis to a statistical H1-verification. Not only do RPS-results feature significantly lower error-rates than NHST-results, RPS also addresses key-deficits of a ``pure'' Frequentist and a standard Bayesian approach. In particular, RPS aggregates underpowered results safely. RPS therefore provides a tool to regain the trust the discipline had lost along the ongoing replicability-crisis.},

  abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this article, we provide a practical introduction to recently developed statistical tools that can be used to deal with these uncertainties when performing and evaluating research. In Part 1, we discuss the importance of accurate and stable effect size estimates as well as how to design studies to reach a corridor of stability around effect size estimates. In Part 2, we explain how, given uncertain effect size estimates, well-powered studies can be designed with sequential analyses. In Part 3, we (a) explain what p values convey about the likelihood that an effect is true, (b) illustrate how the v statistic can be used to evaluate the accuracy of individual studies, and (c) show how the evidential value of multiple studies can be examined with a p-curve analysis. We end by discussing the consequences of incorporating our recommendations in terms of a reduced quantity, but increased quality, of the research output. We hope that the practical recommendations discussed in this article will provide researchers with the tools to make important steps toward a psychological science that allows researchers to differentiate among all possible truths on the basis of their likelihood.},

Traditional multilevel models involve hierarchical data structures whereby lower level units such as students are nested within higher level units such as schools and where these higher level units may in turn be nested within further groupings or clusters such as school districts, regions, and countries. With hierarchical data structures, there is an exact nesting of each lower level unit in one and only one higher level unit. For example, each student attends one school, each school is located within one school district, and so on. However, social reality is more complicated than this, and so social and behavioural data often do not follow pure or strict hierarchies. Two types of non-hierarchical data structures which often appear in practice are cross-classified and multiple membership structures. In this article, we describe cross-classified data structures and cross-classified hierarchical linear modelling which can be used to analyse them.},

To date, research has relied on self-reported mindfulness or heterogeneous mindfulness trainings to infer skillful mindfulness practice and its effects. In four independent studies with over 400 total participants, we present the first construct validation of a behavioral measure of mindfulness, breath counting. We found it was reliable, correlated with self-reported mindfulness, differentiated long-term meditators from age-matched controls, and was distinct from sustained attention and working memory measures. In addition, we employed breath counting to test the nomological network of mindfulness. As theorized, we found skill in breath counting associated with more meta-awareness, less mind wandering, better mood, and greater non-attachment (i.e., less attentional capture by distractors formerly paired with reward). We also found in a randomized online training study that 4 weeks of breath counting training improved mindfulness and decreased mind wandering relative to working memory training and no training controls. Together, these findings provide the first evidence for breath counting as a behavioral measure of mindfulness.},

Modern contexts, however, differ vastly from the environments that existed as human psychological mechanisms evolved. Many inputs now differ in quantity and intensity or no longer have the same fitness associations, thereby leading many mechanisms to produce maladaptive output.

  abstract = {The cgam package contains routines to fit the generalized additive model where the components may be modeled with shape and smoothness assumptions. The main routine is cgam and nineteen symbolic routines are provided to indicate the relationship between the response and each predictor, which satisfies constraints such as monotonicity, convexity, their combinations, tree, and umbrella orderings. The user may specify constrained splines to fit the individual components for continuous predictors, and various types of orderings for the ordinal predictors. In addition, the user may specify parametrically modeled covariates. Two-way interactions between continuous variables, where the relationship with the response is constrained to be monotone, are modeled with "warpedplane splines." The set over which the likelihood is maximized is a polyhedral convex cone, and a least-squares solution is obtained by projecting the data vector onto the cone. For generalized models, the fit is obtained through iteratively re-weighted cone projections. The cone information criterion (CIC) is provided and may be used to compare fits for combinations of variables and shapes. The graphical routine plotpersp will plot an estimated mean surface for a selected pair of predictors, given an object fitted with cgam.

The entropy constructed here is defined only for equilibrium states and no attempt is made to define it otherwise. Statistical mechanics does not enter these considerations. One of the main concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in essence, states that given any two states of the same chemical composition at least one is adiabatically accessible from the other) and we show that it can be derived from some assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of `hotness' is assumed.

Structural equation modeling was used to conduct the multitrait-multimethod, multiple-group, and latent mean analyses. A model with five correlated trait factors and two method factors provided the best fit to the data. Support for convergent and discriminant validity was also found. Racial and gender differences were relatively small for both instruments. These results support the construct validity of the IPIP.

  abstract = {The empirical study of the axioms underlying additive conjoint measurement initially focused mostly on the double cancellation axiom. That axiom was shown to exhibit redundant features that made its statistical evaluation a major challenge. The special case of double cancellation where inequalities are replaced by indifferences \textendash{} the Thomsen condition \textendash{} turned out in the full axiomatic context to be equivalent to the double cancellation property but without exhibiting the redundancies of double cancellation. However, it too has some undesirable features when it comes to its empirical evaluation, the chief among them being a certain statistical asymmetry in estimates used to evaluate it, namely two interlocked hypotheses and a single conclusion. Nevertheless, thinking we had no choice, we evaluated the Thomsen condition for both loudness and brightness and, in agreement with other lines of research, we found more support for conjoint additivity than not. However, we commented on the difficulties we had encountered in evaluating it. Thus we sought a more symmetric replacement, which as Gigerenzer and Strube (1983) first noted, is found in the conjoint commutativity axiom proposed by Falmagne (1976, who called it the ``commutative rule''). It turns out that, in the presence of the usual structural and other necessary assumptions of additive conjoint measurement, we can show that conjoint commutativity is equivalent to the Thomsen condition, a result that seems to have been overlooked in the literature. We subjected this property to empirical evaluation for both loudness and brightness. In contrast to Gigerenzer and Strube (1983), our data show support for the conjoint commutativity in both domains and thus for conjoint additivity.},

Strategic Pluralism Theory (Gangestad \& Simpson, 2000) predicts that men's orientation toward uncommitted mating is facultatively calibrated (i.e. contingently adjusted over ontogeny) in response to condition-dependent physical features, such as strength and attractiveness. Herein, we suggest that previous research bearing on this hypothesis has been limited because (a) researchers have often neglected to distinguish between mating orientations and past sexual behavior and (b) sample sizes have not always been large enough to reliably detect correlations of moderate magnitude. To address these issues and extend previous findings, we present aggregated data from three independent samples of young adults that permit us to examine multiple measures of physical strength and attractiveness in relation to uncommitted mating orientation, committed mating orientation, and past sexual behavior. As predicted, meta-analyses across samples demonstrated that strength and attractiveness were positively correlated with men's (but not women's) uncommitted mating orientation (but not committed mating orientation). In addition, strength (in men only) and attractiveness (in both sexes) positively predicted participants' number of past sex partners. Moreover, path analyses demonstrated that the association of men's physical features with their number of sex partners was mediated via uncommitted mating orientation. These results (a) provide the most extensive support to date for the hypothesis that men's uncommitted mating orientation is calibrated to condition-dependent features and (b) clarify the sex-specific functional links among physical features, mating orientations and sexual behavior.},

The IPIP-NEO is free to use and can be modified to accommodate its users' needs. Despite the substantial interest in this measure, there is still a dearth of data demonstrating its convergence with the NEO PI-R. The present study represents an investigation of the reliability and validity of scores on the IPIP-NEO. Additionally, we used item response theory (IRT) methodology to create a 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO. Using an undergraduate sample (n = 359), we examined the reliability, as well as the convergent and criterion validity, of scores from the 300-item IPIP-NEO, a previously constructed 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO (Johnson, 2011), and the newly created IRT-based IPIP-120 in comparison to the NEO PI-R across a range of outcomes. Scores from all 3 IPIP measures demonstrated strong reliability and convergence with the NEO PI-R and a high degree of similarity with regard to their correlational profiles across the criterion variables (rICC = .983, .972, and .976, respectively). The replicability of these findings was then tested in a community sample (n = 757), and the results closely mirrored the findings from Sample 1. These results provide support for the use of the IPIP-NEO and both 120-item IPIP-NEO measures as assessment tools for measurement of the five-factor model.

Accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE) has taken on increasing importance in light of recent emphasis on effect size estimation and formation of confidence intervals. The review provides an overview of the logic behind sample size planning for AIPE and summarizes recent advances in implementing this approach in designs commonly used in psychological research.},

Researchers have observed considerable covariation among these and other economic games, leading them to assert that there exists a general human propensity to cooperate that varies in strength across individuals and manifests itself across a variety of social settings. To formalize this hypothesis, we created an S-1 bifactor model using 276 participants' Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions. The general factor had significant, moderate associations with self-reported and peer-reported altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. Thus, the positive covariation among economic games is not reducible to the games' shared situational features. Two hundred participants returned for a second session. The general factor based on Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions from this session did not significantly predict self-reported and peer-reported cooperation, suggesting that experience with economic games causes them to measure different traits from those that are reflected in self-assessments and peer-assessments of cooperativeness. \textcopyright{} 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Expressing our innermost thoughts and feelings is critical to the development of intimacy (Reis \& Shaver, 1988), but also risks negative evaluation and rejection. Past research suggests that people with high self-esteem are more expressive and self-disclosing because they trust that others care for them and will not reject them (Gaucher et al., 2012). However, feeling good about oneself may not always be enough; disclosure may also depend on how we feel about other people. Drawing on the principles of risk regulation theory (Murray et al., 2006), we propose that agreeableness-a trait that refers to the positivity of interpersonal motivations and behaviors-is a key determinant of trust in a partner's caring and responsiveness, and may work in conjunction with self-esteem to predict disclosure. We examined this possibility by exploring how both self-esteem and agreeableness predict a particularly risky and intimate form of self-disclosure, the disclosure of emotional distress. In 6 studies using correlational, partner-report, and experimental methods, we demonstrate that self-esteem and agreeableness interact to predict disclosure: People who are high in both self-esteem and agreeableness show higher emotional disclosure. We also found evidence that trust mediates this effect. People high in self-esteem and agreeableness are most self-revealing, it seems, because they are especially trusting of their partners' caring. Self-esteem and agreeableness were particularly important for the disclosure of vulnerable emotions (i.e., sadness; Study 5) and disclosures that were especially risky (Study 6). These findings illustrate how dispositional variables can work together to explain behavior in close relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Simulated data included population variance estimates, which were zero or near zero for two of the five random slopes. Generally, when yielding admissible solutions, all five software packages produced comparable and reasonably unbiased parameter estimates. However, noticeable differences among the five packages arose in terms of speed, convergence rates, and the production of standard errors for random effects, especially when the variances of these effects were zero in the population. The results of this study suggest that applied researchers should carefully consider which random effects they wish to include in their models. In addition, nonconvergence rates vary across packages, and models that fail to converge in one package may converge in another.},

Data from Filipino and French translations are presented, showing clear and detailed replication of the American normative factor structure when targeted rotation is used. Results from these and other cross-cultural and behavior genetic studies suggest that the FFM is a biologically based human universal. Applications of trait psychology in clinical, educational, and organizational settings may prove generalizable across cultures, and cross-cultural psychologists can profitably explore the expression of the same personality traits in different cultural contexts.},

These models utilize the ordinal nature of the data by describing various modes of stochastic ordering and this eliminates the need for assigning scores or otherwise assuming cardinality instead of ordinality. Two models in particular, the proportional odds and the proportional hazards models are likely to be most useful in practice because of the simplicity of their interpretation. These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are discussed and it is shown that even here the method of iteratively reweighted least squares converges to the maximum likelihood estimate, a property which greatly simplifies the necessary computation. Applications are discussed with the aid of examples.}

Our simulation covers both restrictive settings as well as more realistic settings and proceeds across multiple metrics that assess different aspects of model performance. This evaluation is timely in light of two recently proposed approaches, the so-called p-curve and p-uniform approaches, that can be viewed as alternative implementations of the original Hedges selection method approach. We find that the p-curve and p-uniform approaches perform reasonably well but not as well as the original Hedges approach in the restrictive setting for which all three were designed. We also find they perform poorly in more realistic settings, whereas variants of the Hedges approach perform well. We conclude by urging caution in the application of selection methods: Given the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate that purports to adjust for publication bias ex post and more for sensitivity analysis\textemdash that is, exploring the range of estimates that result from assuming different forms of and severity of publication bias.},

In Experiment 1, rats initially learned a discrimination between a two-cycle auditory signal of 2-sec duration and an eight-cycle auditory signal of 8-sec duration. For the number discrimination test, the number of cycles was varied, and the signal duration was held constant at an intermediate value. For the duration discrimination test, the signal duration was varied, and the number of cycles was held constant at an intermediate value. Rats were equally sensitive to a 4:1 ratio of counts (with duration controlled) and a 4:1 ratio of times (with number controlled). The point of subjective equality for the psychophysical functions that related response classification to signal value was near the geometric mean of the extreme values for both number and duration discriminations. Experiment 2 demonstrated that 1.5 mg/kg of methamphetamine administered intraperitoneally shifted the psychophysical functions for both number and duration leftward by approximately 10\%. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the magnitude of cross-modal transfer from auditory signals to cutaneous signals was similar for number and duration. In Experiment 4 the mapping of number onto duration demonstrated that a count was approximately equal to 200 msec. The psychophysical functions for number and duration were fit with a scalar expectancy model with the same parameter values for each attribute. The conclusion was that the same internal mechanism is used for counting and timing. This mechanism can be used in several modes: the "event" mode for counting or the "run" and the "stop" modes for timing.},

Identification accuracy rates for both young and older participants were significantly higher under the long exposure condition. In the short exposure condition, witnesses who had made a correct identification of the target were more confident than incorrect witnesses. In the long exposure condition the confidence ratings of accurate and inaccurate witnesses did not differ. Discussion focuses on the extent to which extended exposure may inflate confidence judgments and variables that may moderate the relationship between exposure duration and face recognition accuracy.},

Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.},

For example, experiments utilizing mouse models in neuroscience often involve collecting multiple neuron measurements per mouse to increase the number of observations without requiring a large number of mice. This leads to a form of statistical dependence referred to as clustering. Inappropriate analyses of clustered data have resulted in several recent critiques of neuroscience research that suggest the bar for statistical analyses within the field is set too low. We compare na\"ive analytical approaches to marginal, fixed-effect, and mixed-effect models and provide guidelines for when each of these models is most appropriate based on study design. We demonstrate the influence of clustering on a between-mouse treatment effect, a within-mouse treatment effect, and an interaction effect between the two. Our analyses demonstrate that these statistical approaches can give substantially different results, primarily when the analyses include a between-mouse treatment effect. In a novel analysis from a neuroscience perspective, we also refine the mixed-effect approach through the inclusion of an aggregate mouse-level counterpart to a within-mouse (neuron level) treatment as an additional predictor by adapting an advanced modeling technique that has been used in social science research and show that this yields more informative results. Based on these findings, we emphasize the importance of appropriate analyses of clustered data, and we aim for this work to serve as a resource for when one is deciding which approach will work best for a given study.},

  abstract = {Declarative memories of personal experiences are a key factor in defining oneself as an individual, which becomes particularly evident when this capability is impaired. Assessing the physiological mechanisms of human declarative memory is typically restricted to patients with specific lesions and requires invasive brain access or functional imaging. We investigated whether the pupil, an accessible physiological measure, can be utilized to probe memories for complex natural visual scenes. During memory encoding, scenes that were later remembered elicited a stronger pupil constriction compared to scenes that were later forgotten. Thus, pupil size predicts success or failure of memory formation. In contrast, novel scenes elicited stronger pupil constriction than familiar scenes during retrieval. When viewing previously memorized scenes, those that were forgotten (misjudged as novel) still elicited stronger pupil constrictions than those correctly judged as familiar. Furthermore, pupil constriction was influenced more strongly if images were judged with high confidence. Thus, we propose that pupil constriction can serve as a marker of novelty. Since stimulus novelty modulates the efficacy of memory formation, our pupil measurements during learning indicate that the later forgotten images were perceived as less novel than the later remembered pictures. Taken together, our data provide evidence that pupil constriction is a physiological correlate of a neural novelty signal during formation and retrieval of declarative memories for complex, natural scenes.},

  abstract = {The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called [Formula: see text] for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression).

This information is generally captured by means of direct scoring, either in the form of a Likert or cardinal scale, or by comparative judgments in pairs or sets. In this sense, the use of pairwise comparisons is becoming increasingly popular because of the simplicity of this experimental procedure. However, this strategy requires non-trivial data analysis to aggregate the comparison ranks into a quality scale and analyse the results, in order to take full advantage of the collected data. This paper explains the process of translating pairwise comparison data into a measurement scale, discusses the benefits and limitations of such scaling methods and introduces a publicly available software in Matlab. We improve on existing scaling methods by introducing outlier analysis, providing methods for computing confidence intervals and statistical testing and introducing a prior, which reduces estimation error when the number of observers is low. Most of our examples focus on image quality assessment.},

  abstract = {The identification of safe gaps between passing cars when crossing a street is a task most of us accomplish successfully on a daily basis. Objectively, how safe a specific gap is, is mainly dependent on how long it would take the approaching vehicle to arrive (time to arrival; TTA). Common sense might suggest that TTA is the basis for pedestrians' gap selection. However, it has been shown repeatedly that vehicle approach speed has a substantial influence on the size of chosen gaps. At higher speeds, pedestrians tend to accept smaller time gaps, i.e. they initiate riskier crossings. Some researchers have gone so far as to suggest that pedestrians rely more on physical distance of a vehicle in their crossing decisions than TTA. Yet, at the same time, there is evidence that TTA estimates themselves are influenced by object approach speed. It is suspected that pedestrians are more apt to base their decisions on systematically distorted TTA estimates, rather than physical distance. The goal of the two experiments described in this article was to explore the relationship between gap acceptance and TTA estimation. Participants were presented with video clips of approaching vehicles, and were either required to indicate a crossing decision, or to estimate TTA. Results show the typical effects of speed (smaller gaps at higher speed, lower TTA estimate at lower speed) and age (larger gaps for older participants). However, when using subjective time gap size (the TTA estimate) instead of objective time gap size to predict gap acceptance, the effect of speed either disappeared (Experiment I) or decreased substantially (Experiment II). The results indicate that systematic differences in TTA estimates can be a reasonable explanation for the effect of speed on gap acceptance.},

Because the cross-observer paradigm can also be useful for examining personality development in late adolescence, this study evaluated the reliability and construct validity of observer ratings on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) in a sample of 101 college students. No such normative information is currently available. Each subject completed the NEO PI-R for themselves and had two individuals familiar to them complete the observer version. The results documented strong internal consistency for each rating scale and a factor structure which replicated previous findings using adult self-reports. Significant peer-peer and peer-self correlations were found as well as numerous cross-observer, cross-instrument convergence between the NEO PI-R ratings and self-reported scores on the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire. The results also indicated the presence of a reverse acquaintanceship effect, where long-term friends provided less accurate ratings than more recent acquaintances.},

In the domain of numerical cognition, the use of linear regression for estimating linear effects (e.g., distance and SNARC effects) became common following Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens, and d'Ydewalle's (1996) study on the SNARC effect. While their work has become the model for analyzing linear effects in the field, it requires statistical analysis of individual participants and does not provide measures of the proportions of variability accounted for (cf. Lorch \& Myers, 1990). In the present methodological note, using both the distance and SNARC effects as examples, we demonstrate how linear effects can be estimated in a simple way within the framework of repeated measures analysis of variance. This method allows for estimating effect sizes in terms of both slope and proportions of variability accounted for. Finally, we show that our method can easily be extended to estimate linear interaction effects, not just linear effects calculated as main effects.},

  abstract = {Impulse activity of individual neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) was recorded from chair-restrained, unanesthetized cynomolgus monkeys. LC activity was closely related to the behavioral state of the animal. In alert waking, LC neurons displayed continuous, moderately irregular activity. In contrast, prolonged pauses in activity accompanied drowsiness. These pauses preceded eye closure and occurred 1-3 s before the onset of slow-wave EEG. At awakening, LC activation preceded by up to 3 s desynchronized EEG and eye opening. LC activity during alertness varied tonically. During behavioral agitation LC activity was higher than during goal-directed task behavior (described below). In addition to these changes in tonic activity, LC neurons were also phasically responsive to certain sensory stimuli. These cells responded selectively to unexpected, meaningful sounds. LC neurons were also recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task in which the monkey was required to selectively release a lever in response to an infrequent visual cue (target cue; CS+) to receive juice reward. LC neurons were selectively activated by CS+ cues in this task; no other task events evoked LC activity. The mean latency of CS+ response was 108 ms (90 ms for multicell recordings), more than 150 ms prior to the behavioral response (lever release). These responses became smaller in later epochs during the session, along with deteriorating task performance. It is proposed that these short-lasting stimulus-evoked LC responses may help optimize behavioral responses and increase vigilance to subsequent sensory stimuli. Together, LC may contribute both to maintaining tonic levels of vigilance and to phasically modulating the current vigilance level in a stimulus-dependent mode.},

Here, we varied the discrimination difficulty in this task and recorded impulse activity of LC neurons to analyze LC responses on error trials and in relation to behavioral response times (RTs). In easy and difficult discrimination conditions, LC neurons responded preferentially to target stimuli with phasic activation. These responses consistently preceded behavioral responses regardless of task difficulty. Latencies for LC and behavioral responses increased similarly for difficult compared with easy discrimination trials. LC response latencies were also shorter for fast RT trials compared with slow RT trials regardless of difficulty, indicating a close temporal relationship between LC and behavioral responses. This relationship was confirmed with response-locked histograms of LC activity, which yielded more temporally synchronized LC responses than stimulus-locked histograms. Population histograms of LC activity revealed that nontarget stimuli resulting in false alarm responses produced phasic LC activation (although smaller than for target-hit trials), and nontarget stimuli resulting in correct rejection responses yielded a small inhibition in LC activity. Population analyses also revealed that LC responses included an early, small excitatory component that was not previously detected. This early response was nondiscriminative because it was similar for target and nontarget stimulus trials. These results indicate that LC neurons exhibit early small magnitude responses that are closely linked to sensory stimuli. In addition, these cells show a later, larger magnitude response that is temporally linked to behavioral responses. These and other results lead us to hypothesize that LC responses are driven by decision processes and help facilitate subsequent behavioral responses.},

As expected, they roughly measure the same aspects of personality. There is a coherent association among four of the five dimensions measured in the tests. However, Agreeableness, the remaining dimension in the NEO PI-R, is not represented in the 16 PF 5. Our analyses confirmed the hierarchical structures of both instruments, but this confirmation was more complete in the case of the NEO PI-R. Indeed, a parallel analysis indicated that a four-factor solution should be considered in the case of the 16 PF 5. On the other hand, the five-factor solution of the NEO PI-R was confirmed. The top-down construction of this instrument seems to make for a more legible structure. Of the two five-dimension constructs, the NEO PI-R, thus, seems the more reliable. This confirms the relevance of the Five-Factor Model of personality.},

Kahneman and Tversky's 1979 study tested financial choices under risk, concluding that such judgements deviate significantly from the assumptions of expected utility theory, which had remarkable impacts on science, policy and industry. Though substantial evidence supports prospect theory, many presumed canonical theories have drawn scrutiny for recent replication failures. In response, we directly test the original methods in a multinational study (n\,=\,4,098 participants, 19 countries, 13 languages), adjusting only for current and local currencies while requiring all participants to respond to all items. The results replicated for 94\% of items, with some attenuation. Twelve of 13 theoretical contrasts replicated, with 100\% replication in some countries. Heterogeneity between countries and intra-individual variation highlight meaningful avenues for future theorizing and applications. We conclude that the empirical foundations for prospect theory replicate beyond any reasonable thresholds.},

Because of this, other parametric or structural assumptions may not be needed at all. Although monotonic regression in one dimension is well studied, the question remains whether one can find computationally feasible generalizations to multiple dimensions. Here, we propose a non-parametric monotonic regression model for one or more covariates and a Bayesian estimation procedure. The monotonic construction is based on marked point processes, where the random point locations and the associated marks (function levels) together form piecewise constant realizations of the regression surfaces. The actual inference is based on model-averaged results over the realizations. The monotonicity of the construction is enforced by partial ordering constraints, which allows it to asymptotically, with increasing density of support points, approximate the family of all monotonic bounded continuous functions.},

The optimal weight to obtain the unbiased and minimum variance estimator is the inverse variance of each effect-size estimate. In practice, it is not possible to compute the optimal inverse variance because the population effect size is unknown. Hedges and Olkin and Hunter and Schmidt proposed two alternative estimators of optimal weights. In this article, the bias and relative efficiency of both estimators are assessed via Monte Carlo simulation, defining the standardized mean difference as the effect-size index. The number of studies, sample size, magnitude of population effect size, and discrepancy between two population effect sizes were manipulated. Hedges and Olkin's estimatorwas more efficient, although more biased, than Hunter and Schmidt's estimator. The consequences of applying both alternatives in meta-analyses are discussed.},

The present study decomposes overall quiz scores into auditory, graphic, and alphanumeric scores to reveal new insights into effects of PowerPoint presentations on student performance. Analyses considered retention of lecture information presented to students without the presence of PowerPoint (i.e., traditional lecture), auditory information in the presence of PowerPoint, and visual (i.e., graphic and alphanumeric) information displayed on PowerPoint slides. Data were collected from 62 students via quiz and questionnaire.

The interpretation of effect sizes\textemdash when is an effect small, medium, or large?\textemdash has been guided by the recommendations Jacob Cohen gave in his pioneering writings starting in 1962: Either compare an effect with the effects found in past research or use certain conventional benchmarks. The present analysis shows that neither of these recommendations is currently applicable. From past publications without pre-registration, 900 effects were randomly drawn and compared with 93 effects from publications with pre-registration, revealing a large difference: Effects from the former (median r = .36) were much larger than effects from the latter (median r = .16). That is, certain biases, such as publication bias or questionable research practices, have caused a dramatic inflation in published effects, making it difficult to compare an actual effect with the real population effects (as these are unknown). In addition, there were very large differences in the mean effects between psychological sub-disciplines and between different study designs, making it impossible to apply any global benchmarks. Many more pre-registered studies are needed in the future to derive a reliable picture of real population effects.},

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

The second result is used in a computer simulation based on principles of parallel distributed processing to account for the effect of central nervous system stimulants on the signal detection performance of human subjects.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Researchers have advocated replacing the DSM-IV classification of personality disorders with an alternative diagnostic system based on the five-factor model. This study evaluates the clinical comprehensiveness of the five-factor model and addresses the broader question of how many factors, and which factors, are necessary to understand personality pathology. METHOD: A national sample of 530 psychiatrists and clinical psychologists used the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure (SWAP-200) to provide detailed psychological descriptions of patients with personality disorder diagnoses. The SWAP-200 is a 200-item instrument designed to capture the richness and complexity of clinical observations while also providing quantifiable data for research. We used factor analysis to identify dimensions of personality relevant to understanding personality pathology. RESULTS: The five-factor structure replicated in a content-restricted subset of 60 SWAP-200 items. However, factor analysis of the full SWAP-200 yielded a conceptually richer factor solution that did not resemble the five-factor model. The analysis identified 12 clinically relevant personality dimensions labeled psychological health, psychopathy, hostility, narcissism, emotional dysregulation, dysphoria, schizoid orientation, obsessionality, thought disorder, oedipal conflict (histrionic sexualization), dissociation, and sexual conflict. CONCLUSIONS: The five-factor model represents a sound distillation of the personality constructs used by laypersons. However, it omits key clinical constructs and may not capture the complexity of personality syndromes seen in clinical practice. The SWAP-200 factors may provide a framework for studying personality pathology that is both empirically grounded and clinically relevant.},

  abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology's lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

Algorithms are given which, compared to previous results, improve the time by a factor of {$\Theta$}\texttildelow{} (|P |) for the L1, L2, and L{$\infty$} metrics. A yet faster algorithm is given for L1 isotonic regression with unweighted data. L{$\infty$} isotonic regression is not unique, and algorithms are given for finding L{$\infty$} regressions with desirable properties such as minimizing the number of large regression errors.},

This study presents a computationally more efficient method for reproducing a population matrix and uses this method to evaluate competing factor solutions of the BDI-II published in the literature.  The results of this study suggest our alternative method can reproduce a population matrix and when used to test various factor solutions of the BDI-II, there is a lack of evidence to suggest any one superior structure.  However, the source of measurement error within some models may help to inform the diagnostic utility of the BDI-II.},

  abstract = {Depressive symptomatology is manifested in greater first-person singular pronoun use (i.e., Italk), but when and for whom this effect is most apparent, and the extent to which it is specific to depression or part of a broader association between negative emotionality and I-talk, remains unclear. Using pooled data from N = 4,754 participants from 6 labs across 2 countries, we examined, in a preregistered analysis, how the depression\textendash I-talk effect varied by (a) first-person singular pronoun type (i.e., subjective, objective, and possessive), (b) the communication context in which language was generated (i.e., personal, momentary thought, identity-related, and impersonal), and (c) gender. Overall, there was a small but reliable positive correlation between depression and I-talk (r = .10, 95\% CI [.07, .13]). The effect was present for all first-person singular pronouns except the possessive type, in all communication contexts except the impersonal one, and for both females and males with little evidence of gender differences. Importantly, a similar pattern of results emerged for negative emotionality. Further, the depression\textendash I-talk effect was substantially reduced when controlled for negative emotionality but this was not the case when the negative emotionality\textendash I-talk effect was controlled for depression. These results suggest that the robust empirical link between depression and I-talk largely reflects a broader association between negative emotionality and I-talk. Self-referential language using first-person singular pronouns may therefore be better construed as a linguistic marker of general distress proneness or negative emotionality rather than as a specific marker of depression.},

We explore the idea that norepinephrine is an essential modulator of memory through its ability to regulate synaptic mechanisms. Emotional arousal leads to activation of the locus coeruleus with the subsequent release of norepineprine in the brain, resulting in the enhancement of memory. Norepinephrine activates both pre- and post-synaptic adrenergic receptors at central synapses with different functional outcomes, depending on the expression pattern of these receptors in specific neural circuitries underlying distinct behavioral processes. We review the evidence for noradrenergic modulation of synaptic plasticity with consideration of how this may contribute to the mechanisms of learning and memory.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

  abstract = {This article reports results from a longitudinal study investigating the effects of low-to-moderate prenatal and postnatal lead exposure on the cognitive development of children during the first 18 months of life. Study hypotheses are expressed as a sequence of linear models for the outcome variable adjusted score on the Bayley Scales of Mental Development (MDIA), as a function of cord blood-lead concentration, infant blood-lead concentration at semiannual examinations, and other characteristics of study participants. These models are fitted to MDIA measurements on three occasions for as many as 214 infants, first assuming an arbitrary multivariate covariance structure for the repeated measurements and then with covariance structure arising from a random-effects model for errors. Estimates of the effects of lead exposure are not sensitive to the assumed covariance structure. The article describes several approaches to residual analysis and outlier detection in the longitudinal setting. In particular, it shows how empirical Bayes residuals can be used to estimate the partial regression coefficient of covariates not included in the linear model. The major findings concerning the effect of lead exposure on cognitive development are (a) a clear association between cord blood-lead concentration and Bayley scores in the first 18 months of life, (b) no clear evidence of an effect of cumulative postnatal exposure, and (c) a tendency for children who had higher lead concentrations at 6 months of age to exhibit poorer performance at 18 months than children with low lead concentrations. These findings have implications for acceptable blood-lead concentrations in children and pregnant women.},

  abstract = {At present, there are many software procedures available enabling statisticians to fit linear mixed models (LMMs) to continuous dependent variables in clustered or longitudinal data sets. LMMs are flexible tools for analyzing relationships among variables in these types of data sets, in that a variety of covariance structures can be used depending on the subject matter under study. The explicit random effects in LMMs allow analysts to make inferences about the variability between clusters or subjects in larger hypothetical populations, and examine cluster- or subject-level variables that explain portions of this variability. These models can also be used to analyze longitudinal or clustered data sets with data that are missing at random (MAR), and can accommodate time-varying covariates in longitudinal data sets. While the software procedures currently available have many features in common, more specific analytic aspects of fitting LMMs (e.g., crossed random effects, appropriate hypothesis testing for variance components, diagnostics, incorporating sampling weights) may only be available in selected software procedures. With this article, we aim to perform a comprehensive and up-to-date comparison of the current capabilities of software procedures for fitting LMMs, and provide statisticians with a guide for selecting a software procedure appropriate for their analytic goals.},

  abstract = {Because of the continuing debates about statistics, many researchers may feel confused about how to analyze and interpret data. Current guidelines in psychology advocate the use of effect sizes and confidence intervals (CIs). However, researchers may be unsure about how to extract effect sizes from factorial designs. Contrast analysis is helpful because it can be used to test specific questions of central interest in studies with factorial designs. It weighs several means and combines them into one or two sets that can be tested with t tests. The effect size produced by a contrast analysis is simply the difference between means. The CI of the effect size informs directly about direction, hypothesis exclusion, and the relevance of the effects of interest. However, any interpretation in terms of precision or likelihood requires the use of likelihood intervals or credible intervals (Bayesian). These various intervals and even a Bayesian t test can be obtained easily with free software. This tutorial reviews these methods to guide researchers in answering the following questions: When I analyze mean differences in factorial designs, where can I find the effects of central interest, and what can I learn about their effect sizes?},

In this article, we take a ``back to basics'' approach, explaining what group selection is, why its rejection was regarded as so important, and how it has been revived based on a more careful formulation and subsequent research. Multilevel selection theory (including group selection) provides an elegant theoretical foundation for sociobiology in the future, once its turbulent past is appropriately understood.},

A comparison of these steps across the two domains reveals both (a) formal parallelism, and (b) important differences in the way calibration is intended and implemented. We examine the similarities and differences to determine whether this is a case of irreducible difference, or whether the similarities are such that measurement in the two domains can be viewed within a single conceptualization.},

However, philosophers have misunderstood Kuhn's view, treating him as a relativist or social constructionist. In this book, Brad Wray argues that Kuhn provides a useful framework for developing an epistemology of science that takes account of the constructive role that social factors play in scientific inquiry. He examines the core concepts of Structure and explains the main characteristics of both Kuhn's evolutionary epistemology and his social epistemology, relating Structure to Kuhn's developed view presented in his later writings. The discussion includes analyses of the Copernican revolution in astronomy and the plate tectonics revolution in geology. The book will be useful for scholars working in science studies, sociologists and historians of science as well as philosophers of science.},

One proposed solution is state trace analysis (Bamber, 1979), which involves plotting, across two or more conditions of interest, performance measured by either two dependent variables, or two conditions of the same dependent measure. The resulting analysis is considered to provide evidence that either: (1) a single process underlies performance (one function is produced) or (2) there is evidence for more than one process (more than one function is produced). This article reports simulations using the simple recurrent network (SRN, Elman, 1990) in which changes to the learning rate produced state trace plots with multiple functions. We also report simulations using a singlelayer error-correcting network that generate plots with a single function. We argue that the presence of different functions on a state trace plot does not necessarily support a dual-system account, at least as typically defined (e.g. two separate autonomous systems competing to control responding); it can also indicate variation in a single parameter within theories generally considered to be single-system accounts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We set out to measure healthy subjects' estimates of temporal duration during the imagination of left and right sides of an object located in either near or far representational space. BACKGROUND: Duration estimates during the observation of small-scale scenes are shorter than those during the observation of the same scenes presented in a larger scale. It is not known whether a similar space-time relationship also exists for objects merely imagined and whether subjective time varies with a forced focus on either the left or the right side of a mental image. METHODS: Eyes closed, 40 healthy, right-handed subjects (20 women) had to imagine a standard Swiss railway clock either at a distance of 30 cm or 6 m. They were required to focus on the imagined movement of the second hand and provide estimates of elapsed durations of 15 and 30 seconds. Separate estimates for the left and right side of the clockface were obtained. The magnitude of implicit line bisection error was assessed in a separate task. RESULTS: Irrespective of side of the clockface, duration estimates were shorter for the clockface imagined in far space than for the one imagined immediately in front of the inner eye. For men, but not women, duration judgments (left relative to right side of the clockface) correlated with relative lengths of left and right line segments in the bisection task. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective time seems to run faster during the inspection of a small-size compared with a larger-size mental image. This finding underlines the equivalence of the laws that guide both exploration and representation of space. Together with the observed correlation between spatial and temporal measures of lateral asymmetries, the result also illustrates the conceptual similarities in the processing of space and time. The normative data presented here may be useful for clinical applications of the paradigm in patients with hemispatial neglect or a distorted perception of time.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) We first proposed that frequency of occurrence information is 'automatically' encoded in the context of a general theoretical framework relating attention and memory encoding (Hasher and Zacks 1979). This chapter begins with a description of the origins of that framework, focusing on earlier evidence indicating that people of all ages and under a very broad range of circumstances reliably and unintentionally encode information about the relative frequencies of events. Notwithstanding challenges to the automatic encoding view, we believe this empirical generalization remains valid today. Additionally, we describe recent examples of findings from research on language processing and statistical reasoning that add to earlier evidence of the critical contribution of frequency knowledge to cognitive and social functioning. Finally, we note that, in a number of respects, the broader intellectual climate in psychology today is more consistent with our approach to memory encoding than was the intellectual climate of the 1970s.

Layouts can be a lot of other things too though \textemdash{} e.g. hive plots and treemaps. One of the driving factors behind ggraph has been to develop an API where any type of visual representation of graph structures is supported.
