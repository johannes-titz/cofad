\description{
This dataset originates from a study conducted as part of a research seminar
in the Psychology B.Sc. program of the University of Cologne. The study
participants learned a list of 20 non-associated word pairs. Each half of the
word pair was associated with one of two sources (imaginating the word pair
in the sky or underwater). The final memory test (cued recall) was conducted
two days later. Cued recall means that one word of the word pair was
presented, and the participant had to recall the other word. The participants
were randomly assigned into one of three between-participant conditions:
restudy, source test, item test.
