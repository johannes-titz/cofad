## Introduction

Cofad is an R package for conducting COntrast analysis in FActorial
Designs like ANOVAs. If contrast analysis was to win a price it would be
the one for the most underestimated, underused statistical technique.
This is unfortunate because in every case a contrast analysis is at
least as good as an ANOVA, but in most cases it is better. Contrast
analysis gets rid off the unspecific omnibus-hypothesis *there are
differences somewhere* and replaces it with a very specific numerical
hypothesis. Furthermore, contrast analysis focuses on effects instead of
significance. This is expressed doubly: First, there are three different
effect sizes for contrast analysis:
![r\_\mathrm{effectsize}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%5Cmathrm%7Beffectsize%7D "r_\mathrm{effectsize}"),
![r\_\mathrm{contrast}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%5Cmathrm%7Bcontrast%7D "r_\mathrm{contrast}")
and
![r\_\mathrm{alerting}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%5Cmathrm%7Balerting%7D "r_\mathrm{alerting}").
Second, the effect size refers not to the data but to the tested
hypothesis. The larger the effect, the more this speaks for the
hypothesis. One can even compare different hypotheses against each other
(experimentum crucis!) by looking at the effect size for each
hypothesis.

Sounds interesting? Then check out some introductory literature such as
Furr (2004), Rosenthal & Rosnow (1985), Rosenthal, Rosnow, & Rubin
(2000), or, for the German-speaking audience, Sedlmeier & Renkewitz
(2018). Contrast analysis is fairly easy to understand if you know what
an ANOVA and a correlation is. In this vignette we assume you are
familiar with the basics of contrast analysis and want to apply it to a
specific data set. First we show how to install cofad and use the
graphical user interface. Then we demonstrate some exemplary analyses
for between, within and mixed designs in R.

## Installation

Cofad has two components, the plain R package and a shiny-app that
offers an intuitive graphical user interface.

If you just want to use the cofad-app, you do not need to install it.
Just go to <https://cofad.titz.science> and use it there. An example
data file is loaded when you add /example after the url.

If you prefer the command line interface or want to use the cofad-app
locally, install it from github (you need the package devtools for
this):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") # uncomment if you do not have devtools installed
devtools::install_github("johannes-titz/cofad")
```

Now you can load cofad and use it in your R scripts.

You can also run the app:

``` r
cofad::run_app()
```

If you have any problems installing cofad, check that your R version is
up to date (currently R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)). If you are using
Windows, enable TLS 1.2 in the Internet Options Advanced tab (see
<https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/issues/130#issuecomment-423830669>).
Under Windows, you will also need Rtools to build the package:
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

If it still does not work drop an e-mail at johannes at titz.science or
at johannes.titz at gmail.com.

## Using cofad

Before we start: Your data has to be in the long-format (also referred
to as narrow or tidy)! If you do not know what this means, please check
the short description of the Wikipedia-article:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data>

### Graphical-User-Interface

The graphical-user-interface is self-explanatory. Just load your data
and drag the variables to the correct position. At the moment you can
only read .sav (SPSS) and .csv files.

As an example go to `https://cofad.titz.science/example` which will load
a data set from Rosenthal et al. (2000) (Table 5.3). The cognitive
ability of nine children belonging to different age groups (between) was
measured four times (within).

There are two hypotheses:

1.  cognitive ability linearly increases over time (within)
    (![\lambda\_\mathrm{1} = -3, \lambda\_\mathrm{2} = -1, \lambda\_\mathrm{3} = 1, \lambda\_\mathrm{4} = 3](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B1%7D%20%3D%20-3%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B2%7D%20%3D%20-1%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B3%7D%20%3D%201%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B4%7D%20%3D%203 "\lambda_\mathrm{1} = -3, \lambda_\mathrm{2} = -1, \lambda_\mathrm{3} = 1, \lambda_\mathrm{4} = 3"))
2.  cognitive ability linearly increase over age groups (between)
    (![\lambda\_\mathrm{Age 8} = -1, \lambda\_\mathrm{Age 10} = 0, \lambda\_\mathrm{Age12} = 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7BAge%208%7D%20%3D%20-1%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7BAge%2010%7D%20%3D%200%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7BAge12%7D%20%3D%201 "\lambda_\mathrm{Age 8} = -1, \lambda_\mathrm{Age 10} = 0, \lambda_\mathrm{Age12} = 1"))

Now drag the variables to the correct position and set the lambdas
accordingly:

<figure>
<img src="gui1b.png" alt="cofad GUI" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">cofad GUI</figcaption>
</figure>

The result should look like this:

<figure>
<img src="gui2b.png" alt="cofad GUI" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">cofad GUI</figcaption>
</figure>

A mixed design is ideal for testing out the cofad-app. You can now
construct a separate within-model by removing the between variable
“age”. Then you can construct a separate between-model by removing
“time” from within and dragging “age” back into the between panel.

The graphical user interface will suffice for most users, but some will
prefer to use the scripting capabilities of R. In the next sections we
will look at several script examples for different designs.

### Between-Subjects Designs

Let us first load the package:

``` r
library(cofad)
```

Now we need some data and hypotheses. We can simply take the data from
Furr (2004), where we have different empathy ratings of students from
different majors. This data set is available in the cofad package:

``` r
data("furr_p4")
furr_p4
#>    empathy      major
#> 1       51 psychology
#> 2       56 psychology
#> 3       61 psychology
#> 4       58 psychology
#> 5       54 psychology
#> 6       62  education
#> 7       67  education
#> 8       57  education
#> 9       65  education
#> 10      59  education
#> 11      50   business
#> 12      49   business
#> 13      47   business
#> 14      45   business
#> 15      44   business
#> 16      50  chemistry
#> 17      45  chemistry
#> 18      40  chemistry
#> 19      49  chemistry
#> 20      41  chemistry
```

Furr states three hypotheses:

- Contrast A: Psychology majors have higher empathy scores than
  Education majors
  (![\lambda\_\mathrm{psych} = 1, \lambda\_\mathrm{edu} = -1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bpsych%7D%20%3D%201%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bedu%7D%20%3D%20-1 "\lambda_\mathrm{psych} = 1, \lambda_\mathrm{edu} = -1")).
- Contrast B: Business majors have higher empathy scores than Chemistry
  majors
  (![\lambda\_\mathrm{bus} = 1, \lambda\_\mathrm{chem} = -1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bbus%7D%20%3D%201%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bchem%7D%20%3D%20-1 "\lambda_\mathrm{bus} = 1, \lambda_\mathrm{chem} = -1")).
- Contrast C: On average, Psychology and Education majors have higher
  empathy scores than Business and Chemistry majors
  (![\lambda\_\mathrm{psych} = 1, \lambda\_\mathrm{edu} = 1, \lambda\_\mathrm{bus} = -1, \lambda\_\mathrm{chem} = -1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bpsych%7D%20%3D%201%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bedu%7D%20%3D%201%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bbus%7D%20%3D%20-1%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7Bchem%7D%20%3D%20-1 "\lambda_\mathrm{psych} = 1, \lambda_\mathrm{edu} = 1, \lambda_\mathrm{bus} = -1, \lambda_\mathrm{chem} = -1")).

These hypotheses are only mean comparisons, but this is a good way to
start. Let’s use cofad to conduct the contrast analysis:

``` r
ca <- calc_contrast(dv = empathy, between = major,
                    lambda_between = c("psychology" = 1, "education" = -1,
                                       "business" = 0, "chemistry" = 0),
                    data = furr_p4)
ca
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: business = 0; chemistry = 0; education = -1; psychology = 1. This resulted in statistics of F(1,16) = 6.154; p = 0.02461 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = -0.276. Attention: Contrast fits in the opposite direction!
```

The print method shows some basic information that can be directly used
in a publication. With the summary method some more details are shown:

``` r
summary(ca)
#> Contrast Analysis Between
#> 
#> Your contrast estimate is negative. This means that your data does not reflect the expected direction of your hypothesis specified by the contrast weights (lambdas).
#> 
#> $Lambdas
#>   business  chemistry  education psychology 
#>          0          0         -1          1 
#> 
#> $tTable
#>   L df      t p(t≥-2.481)①
#>  -6  1 -2.481        0.988
#> 
#> ①The p-value refers to a one-tailed test.
#> 
#> $FTable
#>            SS df     MS     F      p
#> contrast   90  1 90.000 6.154 0.0246
#> within    234 16 14.625             
#> total    1179 19                    
#> 
#> $Effects
#>              effects
#> r_effectsize  -0.276
#> r_contrast    -0.527
#> r_alerting    -0.309
```

From this table,
![r\_\mathrm{effectsize}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%5Cmathrm%7Beffectsize%7D "r_\mathrm{effectsize}")
is probably the most useful statistic. It is just the correlation
between the lambdas and the dependent variable, which can also be
calculated by hand:

``` r
lambdas <- rep(c(1, -1, 0, 0), each = 5)
cor(furr_p4$empathy, lambdas)
#> [1] -0.2762895
```

As you can see, the effect is negative and `cofad` also warns the user
that the contrast fits in the opposite direction. This is a big failure
for the hypothesis and indicates substantial problems in theorizing.

The other two hypotheses can be tested accordingly:

``` r
ca <- calc_contrast(dv = empathy, between = major,
                    lambda_between = c("psychology" = 0, "education" = 0,
                                       "business" = 1, "chemistry" = -1),
                    data = furr_p4)
ca
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: business = 1; chemistry = -1; education = 0; psychology = 0. This resulted in statistics of F(1,16) = 0.684; p = 0.4205 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = 0.092.
```

``` r
ca <- calc_contrast(dv = empathy, between = major,
                    lambda_between = c("psychology" = 1, "education" = 1,
                                       "business" = -1, "chemistry" = -1),
                    data = furr_p4)
ca
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: business = -1; chemistry = -1; education = 1; psychology = 1. This resulted in statistics of F(1,16) = 57.778; p = 1.07e-06 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = 0.847.
```

When you compare the numbers to the ones presented in Furr (2004), you
will find the same result, except that Furr (2004) uses t-values and the
p-values are halved. This is because in contrast analysis you can always
test one-sided. The assumption is that your lambdas covariate positively
with the mean values, not that they either covariate positively or
negatively. Thus, you can always halve the p-value from the F-Test.

Now, imagine we have a more fun hypothesis and not just mean
differences. From an elaborate theory we could derive that the means
should be 73, 61, 51 and 38. We can test this with cofad directly
because cofad will center the lambdas (the mean of the lambdas has to be
0):

``` r
ca <- calc_contrast(dv = empathy, between = major,
                    lambda_between = c("psychology" = 73, "education" = 61,
                                       "business" = 51, "chemistry" = 38),
                    data = furr_p4)
#> lambdas are centered and rounded to 3 digits
```

``` r
ca
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: business = -4.75; chemistry = -17.75; education = 5.25; psychology = 17.25. This resulted in statistics of F(1,16) = 37.466; p = 1.475e-05 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = 0.682.
```

The manual test gives the same effect size:

``` r
lambdas <- rep(c(73, 61, 51, 38), each = 5)
cor(furr_p4$empathy, lambdas)
#> [1] 0.6817294
```

Let us now run an analysis for within-subjects designs.

## Within-Subjects Designs

For within designs the calculations are quite different, but cofad takes
care of the details. We just have to use the within parameters *within*
and *lambda_within* instead of the between equivalents. As an example we
use Table 16.5 from Sedlmeier & Renkewitz (2018). Reading ability was
assessed for eight participants under four different conditions. The
hypothesis is that you can read best without music, white noise reduces
your reading ability and music (independently of type) reduces it even
further.

``` r
data("sedlmeier_p537")
head(sedlmeier_p537)
#>   reading_test participant         music
#> 1           27           1 without music
#> 2           25           2 without music
#> 3           30           3 without music
#> 4           29           4 without music
#> 5           30           5 without music
#> 6           33           6 without music
```

``` r
within <- calc_contrast(dv = reading_test, within = music,
                        lambda_within = c("without music" = 1.25, 
                                          "white noise" = 0.25,
                                          "classic" = -0.75,
                                          "jazz" = -0.75),
                        id = participant, data = sedlmeier_p537)
summary(within)
#> Contrast Analysis Within
#> 
#> $Lambdas
#>       classic          jazz   white noise without music 
#>         -0.75         -0.75          0.25          1.25 
#> 
#> $tTable
#>  mean of L    SE df     t p(t≥5.269)① 95%CI-lower 95%CI-upper

#> 
#> ①The p-value refers to a one-tailed test.
#> 
#> $Effects
#>                 
#> r-contrast 0.687
#> g-contrast 1.863
```

``` r
within
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following within contrasts: classic = -0.75; jazz = -0.75; white noise = 0.25; without music = 1.25. This resulted in statistics of t(7) = 5.269; p = 0.000581 and an effect magnitude of g_effectsize = 1.863.
```

You can see that the significance test is just a
![t](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t "t")-test and the reported
effect size is referring to a mean comparison
(![g](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g "g")). (The
![t](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t "t")-test is one-tailed,
because contrast analysis has always a specific hypothesis.) When
conducting the analysis by hand, we can see why:

``` r
mtr <- matrix(sedlmeier_p537$reading_test, ncol = 4)
lambdas <- c(1.25, 0.25, -0.75, -0.75)
lc1 <- mtr %*% lambdas
t.test(lc1)
#> 
#>  One Sample t-test
#> 
#> data:  lc1
#> t = 5.2689, df = 7, p-value = 0.001162
#> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
#> 95 percent confidence interval:
#>  3.238361 8.511639
#> sample estimates:
#> mean of x 
#>     5.875
```

Only the linear combination of the dependent variable and the contrast
weights for each participant is needed. With these values a normal
![t](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t "t")-test against 0 is
conducted. While you can do this manually, using cofad is quicker and it
also gives you more information, such as the different effect sizes.

## Mixed Designs

A mixed design combines between and within factors. In this case cofad
first calculates the linear combination (*L*-Values) for the within
factor. This new variable serves as the dependent variable for a between
contrast analysis. We will again look at the example presented in
Rosenthal et al. (2000) (see the section graphical user interface). The
cognitive ability of nine children belonging to different age groups
(between) was measured four times (within).

There are two hypotheses:

1.  cognitive ability linearly increases over time (within)
    (![\lambda\_\mathrm{1} = -3, \lambda\_\mathrm{2} = -1, \lambda\_\mathrm{3} = 1, \lambda\_\mathrm{4} = 3](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B1%7D%20%3D%20-3%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B2%7D%20%3D%20-1%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B3%7D%20%3D%201%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7B4%7D%20%3D%203 "\lambda_\mathrm{1} = -3, \lambda_\mathrm{2} = -1, \lambda_\mathrm{3} = 1, \lambda_\mathrm{4} = 3"))
2.  cognitive ability linearly increase over age groups (between)
    (![\lambda\_\mathrm{Age 8} = -1, \lambda\_\mathrm{Age 10} = 0, \lambda\_\mathrm{Age12} = 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7BAge%208%7D%20%3D%20-1%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7BAge%2010%7D%20%3D%200%2C%20%5Clambda_%5Cmathrm%7BAge12%7D%20%3D%201 "\lambda_\mathrm{Age 8} = -1, \lambda_\mathrm{Age 10} = 0, \lambda_\mathrm{Age12} = 1"))

Let’s have a look at the data and calculation:

``` r
data("rosenthal_tbl53")
head(rosenthal_tbl53)
#>   dv between id within
#> 1  3    age8  1      1
#> 2  1    age8  2      1
#> 3  4    age8  3      1
#> 4  4   age10  4      1
#> 5  5   age10  5      1
#> 6  5   age10  6      1
```

``` r
lambda_within <- c("1" = -3, "2" = -1, "3" = 1, "4" = 3)
lambda_between <-c("age8" = -1, "age10" = 0, "age12" = 1)

contr_mx <- calc_contrast(dv = dv, 
                          between = between,
                          lambda_between = lambda_between,
                          within = within,
                          lambda_within = lambda_within,
                          id = id, 
                          data = rosenthal_tbl53)
contr_mx
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: age10 = 0; age12 = 1; age8 = -1. This resulted in statistics of F(1,6) = 20.211; p = 0.004123 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = 0.871.
```

The results look like a contrast analysis for between-subject designs.
The summary gives some more details: The effect sizes, within group
means and standard errors of the *L*-values.

``` r
summary(contr_mx)
#> Contrast Analysis Mixed

## Comparing two hypotheses

With `cofad` you can also compare two competing hypotheses. As an
example Sedlmeier & Renkewitz (2013) use a fictitious data set on
problem solving skills of boys:

``` r
sedlmeier_p525
#>    lsg between lambda
#> 1    1      KT     -2
#> 2    2      KT     -2
#> 3    2      KT     -2
#> 4    2      KT     -2
#> 5    3      KT     -2
#> 6    4      JT      3
#> 7    2      JT      3
#> 8    3      JT      3
#> 9    4      JT      3
#> 10   3      JT      3
#> 11   2      MT     -1
#> 12   3      MT     -1
#> 13   3      MT     -1
#> 14   1      MT     -1
#> 15   2      MT     -1
```

Where lsg is the number of solved exercises and the groups are KT = no
training, JT = boys-specific training, MT=girls-specific training. Two
hypotheses are competing:

- -2, 3, -1 (boys benefit from boys-specific training)
- -2, 1, 1 (boys benefit from training, independently of the type of
  training)

First, we need to create the difference lambdas:

``` r
lambda1 <- c(-2, 3, -1)
lambda2 <- c(-2, 1, 1)
lambda <- lambda_diff(lambda1, lambda2, labels = c("KT", "JT", "MT"))
lambda
#>         JT         KT         MT 
#>  0.6816234  0.4883935 -1.1700168
```

Note that you cannot just subtract the lambdas because their variance
can differ, which has an effect on the test. Instead, you need to
standardize the lambdas first. `lambda_diff` takes care of this for you.

Now you can run a normal contrast analysis:

``` r
ca_competing <- calc_contrast(
  dv = lsg,
  between = between,
  lambda_between = round(lambda, 2),
  data = sedlmeier_p525
)
#> lambdas are centered and rounded to 3 digits
```

``` r
summary(ca_competing)
#> Contrast Analysis Between
#> 
#> $Lambdas
#>    JT    KT    MT 
#>  0.68  0.49 -1.17 
#> 
#> $tTable
#>      L df     t p(t≥1.136)①
#>  0.582  1 1.136       0.139
#> 
#> ①The p-value refers to a one-tailed test.
#> 
#> $FTable
#>              SS df    MS     F     p
#> contrast  0.818  1 0.818 1.291 0.278
#> within    7.600 12 0.633            
#> total    11.733 14                  
#> 
#> $Effects
#>              effects
#> r_effectsize   0.264
#> r_contrast     0.312
#> r_alerting     0.445
```

``` r
ca_competing
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: JT = 0.68; KT = 0.49; MT = -1.17. This resulted in statistics of F(1,12) = 1.291; p = 0.278 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = 0.264.
```

Here, we rounded the lambdas so that the result is similar to the one in
Sedlmeier & Renkewitz (2013), who found t=1.137 and r_effectsize=0.26.
The effet size is the same. For the t-value, we need to take the root of
the F-value, 1.291, which is 1.136. There is still a slight difference
to the original result of 1.137, which is likely due to rounding errors.

The same also works for within-designs. The reading comprehension data
from above can serve as an example. Reading ability was assessed for
eight participants under four different conditions:

``` r
sedlmeier_p537
#>    reading_test participant         music
#> 1            27           1 without music
#> 2            25           2 without music
#> 3            30           3 without music
#> 4            29           4 without music
#> 5            30           5 without music
#> 6            33           6 without music
#> 7            31           7 without music
#> 8            35           8 without music
#> 9            25           1   white noise
#> 10           26           2   white noise
#> 11           32           3   white noise
#> 12           29           4   white noise
#> 13           28           5   white noise
#> 14           30           6   white noise
#> 15           32           7   white noise
#> 16           34           8   white noise
#> 17           21           1       classic
#> 18           25           2       classic
#> 19           23           3       classic
#> 20           26           4       classic
#> 21           27           5       classic
#> 22           26           6       classic
#> 23           29           7       classic
#> 24           31           8       classic
#> 25           23           1          jazz
#> 26           24           2          jazz
#> 27           24           3          jazz
#> 28           28           4          jazz
#> 29           24           5          jazz
#> 30           26           6          jazz
#> 31           27           7          jazz
#> 32           32           8          jazz
```

There are two hypotheses:

- 1.25, 0.25, -0.75, -0.75: You can read best without music, white noise
  reduces your reading ability and music (independently of type) reduces
  it even further.
- 3, -1, -1, -1: Noise of any kind reduces reading ability.

Again, we need to calculate the difference lambdas first:

``` r
lambda1 <- c(1.25, 0.25, -0.75, -0.75)
lambda2 <- c(3, -1, -1, -1)
lambda <- lambda_diff(lambda2, lambda1,
                      labels = c("without music", "white noise", "classic",
                                 "jazz"))
lambda
#>       classic          jazz   white noise without music 
#>     0.3271838     0.3271838    -0.8788616     0.2244941
```

Note that we use lambda2 as the first entry into `lambda_diff` because
this is how Sedlmeier & Renkewitz (2013) calculated it
(hypothesis2-hypothesis1).

And now the contrast analysis:

``` r
contr_wi <- calc_contrast(
  dv = reading_test,
  within = music,
  lambda_within = round(lambda, 2),
  id = participant,
  data = sedlmeier_p537
)
#> lambdas are centered and rounded to 3 digits
```

``` r
summary(contr_wi)
#> Contrast Analysis Within
#> 
#> Your contrast estimate is negative. This means that your data does not reflect the expected direction of your hypothesis specified by the contrast weights (lambdas).
#> 
#> $Lambdas
#>       classic          jazz   white noise without music 
#>          0.33          0.33         -0.88          0.22 
#> 
#> $tTable
#>  mean of L    SE df     t p(t≥-3.77)① 95%CI-lower 95%CI-upper
#>       -2.2 0.584  7 -3.77       0.997       -3.58       -0.82
#> 
#> ①The p-value refers to a one-tailed test.
#> 
#> $Effects
#>                  
#> r-contrast -0.561
#> g-contrast -1.333
```

``` r
contr_wi
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following within contrasts: classic = 0.33; jazz = 0.33; white noise = -0.88; without music = 0.22. This resulted in statistics of t(7) = -3.77; p = 0.9965 and an effect magnitude of g_effectsize = -1.333. Attention: Contrast fits in the opposite direction!
```

Sedlmeier & Renkewitz (2013) found a t-value of -3.75 and a g_contrast
of -1.33. Again, there is a slight difference for the t-value when
compared to our calculation, likely due to rounding errors. Further
note, that hypothesis 1 fits better because the statistic and effect are
negative.

## Aggregated Data

Sometimes you would like to run a contrast analysis on aggregated data
(e.g. when no raw data is available). If you have the means, standard
deviations and sample sizes for every condition, you can do this with
cofad. For instance, if we take our first example and aggregate it, we
can still run the contrast analysis:

``` r
library(dplyr)
furr_agg <- furr_p4 %>% 
  group_by(major) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(empathy), sd = sd(empathy), n = n())
lambdas = c("psychology" = 1, "education" = -1, "business" = 0, "chemistry" = 0)
calc_contrast_aggregated(mean, sd, n, major, lambdas, furr_agg)
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: business = 0; chemistry = 0; education = -1; psychology = 1. This resulted in statistics of F(1,16) = 6.154; p = 0.02461 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = -0.276. Attention: Contrast fits in the opposite direction!
```

And the result is indeed the same when compared to the analysis with the
raw data:

``` r
ca <- calc_contrast(dv = empathy, between = major,
                    lambda_between = c("psychology" = 1, "education" = -1,
                                       "business" = 0, "chemistry" = 0),
                    data = furr_p4)
ca
#> 
#> We ran a contrast analysis for the following between contrasts: business = 0; chemistry = 0; education = -1; psychology = 1. This resulted in statistics of F(1,16) = 6.154; p = 0.02461 and an effect magnitude of r_effectsize = -0.276. Attention: Contrast fits in the opposite direction!
```

Note that this will only work for between-subjects designs.

## Testing

The current test coverage for the package stands at 88%. Within `cofad`,
there exists a Shiny app, subjected to testing through shinytest2.
Regrettably, this testing approach proves less robust, leading to
unpredictable failures specifically on the Windows OS when executed
through GitHub Actions. Consequently, these tests are omitted during
GitHub runs and are exclusively conducted on a local environment.
